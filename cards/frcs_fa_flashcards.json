      "question": "Name the three facets of the subtalar joint, which are most commonly involved in arthritis, and the key stabilising ligament complex.",
      "answer": "Facets: posterior, middle, anterior. Arthritis most commonly affects the posterior facet (largest load-bearing), then middle; anterior is less commonly isolated. Key stabiliser: interosseous talocalcaneal ligament within the tarsal canal/sinus tarsi (with cervical ligament contributing).",
      "explanation": "The posterior facet is the main congruent articulation and takes most load, so it is the commonest site of degenerative change. The interosseous talocalcaneal ligament is central to subtalar stability and is relevant in sinus tarsi pain and subtalar instability. Viva trap: confusing the tarsal canal (medial) with sinus tarsi (lateral) but both house stabilising structures.",

      "question": "On CT of the calcaneus, what is the sustentaculum tali, why is it surgically important, and which structure runs beneath it?",
      "answer": "The sustentaculum tali is the medial bony shelf supporting the talar middle facet; it is a constant fragment in intra-articular calcaneal fractures and a key reference for reduction/fixation. The flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon runs in a groove beneath it.",
      "explanation": "The sustentaculum is relatively tethered by strong ligaments, so it often remains aligned with the talus while the tuberosity and posterior facet displace—useful for orientating reduction. FHL irritation/entrapment can occur with medial wall blowout or screws placed too long. Pitfall: assuming the sustentaculum is always “safe” for screw purchase without checking medial neurovascular structures and screw length.",

      "question": "Which part of the talar dome is wider, and what is the clinical implication for ankle stability in plantarflexion vs dorsiflexion?",
      "answer": "The anterior talar dome is wider than the posterior. The ankle mortise is more stable in dorsiflexion (wider anterior dome wedged in mortise) and less stable in plantarflexion (narrower posterior dome).",
      "explanation": "This underpins why many ankle sprains occur in plantarflexion/inversion and why syndesmotic instability is more apparent when the talus is not “wedged”. Viva trap: attributing stability solely to ligaments—bony congruity changes with ankle position are key.",

The PITFL (including its deep/transverse component) is the strongest restraint to external rotation and posterior translation of the fibula.",
      "explanation": "Understanding relative strength guides interpretation: isolated AITFL injuries can be subtle, while PITFL disruption implies more severe instability.

      "answer": "The superficial peroneal nerve is at risk; it typically emerges from the lateral compartment in the distal third of the leg and crosses anterior to the fibula toward the dorsum of the foot. Injury causes dorsal foot paraesthesia/neuropathic pain (often sparing the first web space).",
      "explanation": "The emergence point is variable, so careful blunt dissection in the distal third is essential. Viva trap: confusing with the deep peroneal nerve (first web space sensation) or sural nerve (lateral foot).",

      "answer": "The Lisfranc ligament is the strong interosseous ligament from the lateral aspect of the medial cuneiform to the medial base of the 2nd metatarsal. There is no intermetatarsal ligament between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases to allow motion and accommodate the keystone position of the 2nd metatarsal in the cuneiform mortise.",
      "explanation": "This anatomic gap explains why subtle diastasis between the 1st and 2nd rays is a key sign of Lisfranc injury. Viva trap: calling the dorsal ligament the main stabiliser—plantar/interosseous structures are stronger; dorsal disruption may be the only visible injury early.",

      "answer": "AP: medial border of the 2nd metatarsal aligns with medial border of the intermediate cuneiform; medial border of 1st metatarsal aligns with medial cuneiform. Oblique: medial border of the 4th metatarsal aligns with medial border of the cuboid; lateral border of the 3rd metatarsal aligns with lateral cuneiform. Any step-off/diastasis suggests TMT instability.",

      "answer": "Medial column: talus–navicular–medial cuneiform–1st metatarsal. Middle column: intermediate/lateral cuneiforms–2nd/3rd metatarsals. Lateral column: calcaneus–cuboid–4th/5th metatarsals. The lateral column is most mobile (calcaneocuboid joint contributes), so over-stiffening it can cause lateral pain and adjacent joint overload.",
      "explanation": "Column thinking guides fusion choices in Charcot, post-traumatic collapse, and flatfoot reconstructions. Viva trap: fusing the entire lateral column routinely—preserving motion at the calcaneocuboid joint is often desirable unless it is arthritic/unstable.",

      "answer": "Chopart joint comprises the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints. The talonavicular joint is the key 'ball-and-socket' articulation that largely governs hindfoot inversion/eversion coupling with the subtalar joint.",
      "explanation": "Talonavicular fusion markedly reduces hindfoot motion because it blocks the principal rotational interface; calcaneocuboid fusion alone has a smaller effect. Pitfall: underestimating stiffness after talonavicular fusion and not counselling about adjacent joint overload.",

      "answer": "The navicular has a relatively tenuous intraosseous blood supply with watershed zones; fractures can disrupt dorsal and plantar arterial contributions. The central third is classically most vulnerable to AVN/nonunion.",
      "explanation": "This influences fixation strategy (stable compression, avoid excessive periosteal stripping) and follow-up (delayed union common).

      "answer": "The 1st ray comprises the 1st metatarsal and medial cuneiform (functionally including the 1st TMT joint). Hypermobility allows medial column instability with metatarsus primus varus and reduces the stabilising effect of peroneus longus/plantar fascia, promoting lateral drift of the hallux and sesamoid subluxation.",
      "explanation": "This is why a Lapidus (1st TMT fusion) is considered when there is symptomatic TMT instability or severe deformity. Pitfall: equating “hypermobility” with any increased motion—assess clinically and correlate with deformity severity and recurrence risk.",

      "answer": "Sesamoid apparatus includes the medial and lateral sesamoids embedded in flexor hallucis brevis, connected by the intersesamoid ligament, with plantar plate, metatarsosesamoid ligaments, and attachments from abductor hallucis (medial) and adductor hallucis (lateral). Function: increase the moment arm of FHB, protect FHL, and stabilise/centralise the 1st MTP during push-off.",
      "explanation": "Disruption or malalignment leads to transfer metatarsalgia and hallux MTP instability. Pitfall: missing bipartite sesamoid (often smooth corticated margins) versus fracture (sharp irregular line) on imaging.",

      "answer": "Hammer toe: PIP flexion with MTP extension (DIP often neutral/extended); mallet toe: DIP flexion; claw toe: MTP extension with PIP and DIP flexion. Typical imbalance is intrinsic muscle weakness with extrinsic overpull (long extensors/flexors), often with MTP instability/plantar plate insufficiency in clawing.",
      "explanation": "Joint pattern predicts operative target (e.g., plantar plate/MTP stabilisation for clawing vs isolated DIP procedure for mallet). Pitfall: treating only the PIP without addressing MTP instability—recurrence and floating toe are common.",

      "question": "What are the key anatomical zones at the base of the 5th metatarsal and which tendon inserts where (relevant to avulsion vs Jones fractures)?",
      "answer": "Zone 1: tuberosity (styloid) – peroneus brevis inserts here; plantar fascia/lateral band also attaches. Zone 2: metaphyseal–diaphyseal junction (Jones region) – no major tendon insertion; watershed blood supply. Zone 3: proximal diaphysis – stress fracture region; peroneus tertius inserts more dorsally at the base/shaft junction.",
      "explanation": "Tendon pull explains avulsion fractures (zone 1) and why zone 2 has higher nonunion risk (vascular watershed). Viva trap: calling all base fractures “Jones”—true Jones is zone 2 and has different management implications.",

      "answer": "The posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL) attaches to the posterior malleolus. Posterior malleolar injury can destabilise the syndesmosis and contribute to posterior talar subluxation and rotational instability.",
      "explanation": "This is why CT assessment of fragment size, impaction, and incisura involvement matters; fixation can restore syndesmotic stability and reduce need for trans-syndesmotic screws in selected cases.

Key risk: iatrogenic injury/entrapment of the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle or tibial nerve branches with medial hardware or retraction.",

      "answer": "Normally the calcaneus is in slight valgus relative to the tibial axis (approximately 0–5° valgus). Compensation occurs mainly through the subtalar joint and transverse tarsal (talonavicular/calcaneocuboid) joints; fixed deformity limits compensation and shifts load to the ankle and midfoot.",
      "explanation": "This underpins why hindfoot varus predisposes to lateral ankle instability and peroneal overload, while valgus overloads the medial column and tibialis posterior.

      "answer": "Naviculocuneiform arthritis shows joint space loss/osteophytes between navicular and cuneiforms (more proximal, affects medial arch on lateral view); TMT arthritis affects the bases of metatarsals with cuneiforms/cuboid (more distal, often with dorsal bossing). It matters because fusion level selection differs: NC fusion addresses medial arch collapse proximally, whereas TMT fusion targets the Lisfranc complex and forefoot-driven pain/bossing.",

      "question": "On lateral hindfoot imaging, which calcaneal landmarks and angles must you identify to describe hindfoot alignment and subtalar joint involvement, and what do they imply?",
      "answer": "Identify: Böhler’s angle (normal ~20–40°; reduced suggests posterior facet depression), Gissane’s angle (normal ~120–145°; increased/abnormal suggests posterior facet disruption), posterior facet congruity, calcaneal height/length/width, and the calcaneal pitch (arch). Also assess hindfoot varus/valgus (Saltzman view) and peroneal tubercle/lateral wall blow-out (risk of peroneal impingement). These guide whether pain is likely subtalar arthrosis/malunion and whether correction needs height/varus restoration in addition to fusion.",
      "explanation": "FRCS trap is describing “subtalar arthritis” without demonstrating you can read alignment: loss of height and varus malunion drive lateral overload and persistent pain even after fusion. Böhler’s angle is a quick surrogate for posterior facet depression but must be interpreted with overall morphology and CT. Lateral wall blow-out and peroneal impingement are common missed pain generators.

      "question": "Which talar blood supply features are most relevant in talar neck/body fractures, and how does fracture pattern influence AVN risk?",
      "answer": "Key supply: artery of the tarsal canal (posterior tibial) to talar body, artery of the sinus tarsi (anastomosis from perforating peroneal/dorsalis pedis) to neck/head, and deltoid branches (posterior tibial) that can preserve body perfusion if deltoid attachment remains. Increasing displacement and subtalar/ankle dislocation (Hawkins progression) disrupts these vessels and increases AVN risk; intact deltoid soft-tissue hinge is protective.",
      "explanation": "The viva pitfall is saying “talus has poor blood supply” without specifying the tarsal canal/sinus tarsi system and the deltoid contribution. Neck fractures can sever the anastomosis; body fractures further endanger the tarsal canal supply. Hawkins sign (subchondral lucency at 6–8 weeks) suggests revascularisation; absence is not diagnostic of AVN.

      "answer": "Assess tibiofibular clear space (TFCS) and tibiofibular overlap (TFO) on AP/mortise, plus medial clear space (MCS) relative to superior clear space. Look for fibular length/rotation (posterior malleolus involvement affects incisura congruity) and talar shift. Traps: relying on absolute mm cut-offs without comparing to the contralateral side, poor mortise positioning, and missing posterior malleolar/intra-incisural fragments on CT that cause persistent diastasis despite “normal” plain films.",
      "explanation": "Syndesmotic stability is about congruent reduction in the incisura, not just a single measurement. Malrotated fibula can look “in place” yet widen the mortise and increase contact pressures.

      "answer": "Normal alignment: on AP, medial border of 2nd metatarsal aligns with medial border of intermediate cuneiform; medial border of 1st metatarsal aligns with medial cuneiform. On oblique, medial border of 3rd metatarsal aligns with medial border of lateral cuneiform; 4th metatarsal aligns with cuboid. On lateral, no dorsal step-off at TMT joints. Key stabiliser: Lisfranc ligament from medial cuneiform to base of 2nd metatarsal (no intermetatarsal ligament between 1st–2nd rays).",
      "explanation": "The classic viva trap is quoting “diastasis >2 mm” without demonstrating you know which lines should be colinear on WB views. The 2nd metatarsal is the keystone; subtle malalignment here is highly suspicious. Non-weight-bearing films can be falsely normal; WB radiographs (or stress/CT/MRI) are often needed.

      "answer": "Measure: hallux valgus angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle (IMA 1–2), distal metatarsal articular angle (DMAA), and assess sesamoid position/coverage and 1st MTP congruency. Recurrence drivers: persistent 1st ray instability/hypermobility, inadequate sesamoid reduction (failure to correct pronation/rotation of 1st metatarsal), and uncorrected metatarsus primus varus or increased DMAA.",
      "explanation": "A common viva pitfall is giving only HVA/IMA numbers and ignoring sesamoids and metatarsal rotation, which are key to durable correction. Sesamoids are tethered by the plantar plate and intersesamoid ligament; if the metatarsal remains pronated, the sesamoids appear “lateralised” and recurrence is likely. WB films are essential because non-WB underestimates deformity and 1st ray instability.",

      "question": "Which intermetatarsal space most commonly contains Morton’s neuroma, what nerve is involved, and what anatomical feature explains its typical location?",
      "answer": "Most common: 3rd intermetatarsal space (between 3rd–4th metatarsal heads), involving the common plantar digital nerve (usually from the medial and lateral plantar nerve contributions). The 3rd space is predisposed because the nerve is larger (dual supply) and is tethered beneath the deep transverse metatarsal ligament, making it vulnerable to repetitive compression/shear.",
      "explanation": "The examiner wants anatomy-driven reasoning, not just “3rd web space”. Neuroma symptoms can mimic MTP synovitis/plantar plate tear; localisation and provocation tests help but imaging may be needed. A trap is confusing it with interdigital bursitis or attributing pain to “metatarsalgia” without considering plantar plate pathology at the 2nd MTP.",

      "question": "What is the spring ligament complex, where does it attach, and why is it critical in adult acquired flatfoot deformity?",
      "answer": "Spring ligament complex (plantar calcaneonavicular ligament) spans from sustentaculum tali (calcaneus) to plantar/medial navicular, supporting the talar head and the medial longitudinal arch; includes superomedial and inferior components. Failure/attenuation allows talar head plantar-medial subluxation at the talonavicular joint, contributing to forefoot abduction and collapse even if tibialis posterior is addressed.",
      "explanation": "A viva trap is describing AAFD as purely “tibialis posterior rupture”. The spring ligament is a static restraint; if incompetent, tendon procedures alone may not restore talonavicular coverage.

Roof: flexor retinaculum; floor includes medial malleolus, talus, calcaneus. Hindfoot valgus can tension/compress the tunnel and contribute to tibial nerve symptoms, especially with flatfoot and tenosynovitis.",

Jones fracture: zone 2 at the metaphyseal–diaphyseal junction extending into the 4th–5th intermetatarsal articulation. Proximal diaphyseal stress fracture: zone 3 more distal diaphysis. Nonunion risk is higher in zones 2–3 due to a relative watershed blood supply at the metaphyseal–diaphyseal junction and higher bending stresses.",

Clue: dorsal osteophytes/joint space loss centred proximal to the 1st TMT (at the naviculocuneiform line) with relative preservation of the 1st TMT joint; pain is often more midfoot-central rather than purely medial at the 1st TMT.",
      "explanation": "In vivas, candidates often label any medial midfoot arthritis as “1st TMT” and propose a Lapidus without confirming the level.

      "question": "What is the plantar plate at the lesser MTP joints, where does it attach, and how does its failure produce a crossover/hammer toe pattern?",
      "answer": "The plantar plate is a fibrocartilaginous structure forming the plantar restraint of the MTP joint; it attaches firmly to the base of the proximal phalanx and more loosely to the metatarsal neck, blending with collateral ligaments and the deep transverse metatarsal ligament. Failure (often at the phalangeal attachment) allows dorsal subluxation of the proximal phalanx, with intrinsic/extrinsic tendon imbalance leading to hammer toe and, with medial/lateral collateral attenuation, crossover deformity (commonly 2nd toe).",
      "explanation": "The examiner is probing whether you understand the anatomical cause of “metatarsalgia with toe drift” rather than blaming long metatarsals alone. Plantar plate rupture explains a positive drawer test at the MTP and why symptoms are plantar at the metatarsal head.

      "answer": "Syndesmosis = AITFL, PITFL (incl. transverse ligament), interosseous ligament/membrane, and deltoid (functional partner). Key restraint to external rotation is the PITFL (strongest), with AITFL commonly failing first; deltoid integrity is critical to overall mortise stability.",
      "explanation": "Viva trap: candidates focus only on AITFL/PITFL and forget the deltoid’s role—syndesmotic fixation without addressing a deltoid rupture can leave persistent instability.

      "explanation": "Syndesmotic assessment is highly sensitive to positioning; a slightly internally/externally rotated mortise can change overlap/clear space.

External rotation stress test: ER of foot—widening of medial clear space and/or syndesmosis. Positive = clear, reproducible widening compared with contralateral/expected anatomy under fluoroscopy.",

Fix if the mortise is unstable, not simply because it is a Weber C.",
      "explanation": "Viva trap: “Weber C = always syndesmotic screw” is wrong—some are stable after fibular and posterior malleolar fixation.

Errors: clamping malreduced fibula (short/externally rotated), screw too low into joint, wrong trajectory, over-compression with clamp, and failure to confirm on mortise + true lateral/CT.",
      "explanation": "Most poor outcomes relate to syndesmotic malreduction rather than the screw itself.

Complications: soft-tissue irritation, osteolysis around buttons, loss of reduction if malpositioned, medial neurovascular irritation, and persistent pain if deltoid/posterior malleolus pathology unaddressed.",

Most relevant when the posterior fragment is sizeable, displaced, or involves the incisura/has step-off, and in rotational ankle fractures with syndesmotic instability.",
      "explanation": "Viva trap: using fragment size alone (e.g., “>25%”) is outdated; morphology (incisura involvement, displacement, articular congruity) and stability matter.

      "question": "In an ankle fracture with medial clear space widening, when is deltoid ligament repair indicated, and what is the common exam trap?",
      "answer": "Repair is considered if, after anatomical fibular (and posterior malleolus if present) fixation, the mortise remains unstable with persistent medial clear space widening or talar tilt, or if there is interposed tissue preventing reduction. Trap: repairing deltoid routinely instead of first restoring fibular length/rotation and addressing syndesmosis/posterior malleolus.",
      "explanation": "Most medial clear space widening reduces once the lateral side and posterior malleolus are anatomically fixed; routine deltoid repair is not mandatory. However, persistent instability suggests either deltoid incompetence or malreduction elsewhere—confirm with fluoroscopy/CT. Overlooking deltoid interposition can lead to an irreducible mortise.",

      "question": "Which structures are the primary stabilisers of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis, and what is the key functional consequence of syndesmotic disruption?",
      "answer": "Primary stabilisers: anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL), posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL) including the transverse tibiofibular ligament, and the interosseous ligament/membrane (IOL/IOM). The deltoid ligament provides medial restraint and is commonly co-injured. Disruption permits fibular external rotation and lateral translation with talar shift, increasing tibiotalar contact pressures and leading to early arthritis if malreduced.",
      "explanation": "In viva, candidates often over-focus on the IOM and understate the PITFL/transverse ligament, which are major posterior restraints. The clinical problem is not just “diastasis” but malrotation/malposition of the fibula in the incisura causing talar shift. A medial injury (deltoid rupture or medial malleolar fracture) is a key clue that the mortise is unstable and must be restored anatomically.",

      "question": "On weight-bearing ankle radiographs, which measurements are most useful for syndesmotic injury, and what are the common pitfalls in interpreting them?",
      "answer": "Useful: medial clear space (MCS) on mortise view (should be ≤ superior clear space and typically <4 mm), tibiofibular overlap (TFO) and tibiofibular clear space (TFCS) on AP/mortise views. Pitfalls: non-true mortise/AP rotation alters TFO/TFCS; non-weight-bearing films can underestimate instability; MCS widening may reflect deltoid injury even without syndesmotic diastasis; normal ranges vary so compare with contralateral side if uncertain.",
      "explanation": "Radiographic parameters are sensitive to positioning; a slightly rotated mortise can falsely “normalise” overlap or exaggerate clear space. WB views (when safe) better demonstrate functional instability. If doubt persists, stress views, intra-operative stress testing, or CT (including comparison/side-to-side) helps identify malreduction or subtle fibular malposition.",

      "answer": "After fibular length/rotation are restored, perform an external rotation stress test and/or hook (Cotton) test under fluoroscopy. Instability is suggested by increased MCS, widening of TFCS, loss of TFO, or visible lateral translation/external rotation of the fibula relative to the incisura. Fixation is indicated when the mortise is unstable (especially MCS widening/talar shift) after bony fixation and deltoid/medial side addressed.",
      "explanation": "A common pitfall is testing before restoring fibular anatomy—this can create false positives. The key endpoint is talar shift/medial clear space change, not just a small change in TFCS. If the medial side is not stabilised (deltoid rupture/medial malleolus), syndesmotic tests can be misleading; restore medial stability first or interpret in that context.",

      "question": "Compare screw fixation versus suture-button for syndesmosis: key indications, construct principles, and common failure modes.",
      "answer": "Screw fixation: good for clear diastasis/instability; typically 1–2 screws (3.5 or 4.5 mm) placed 2–4 cm above plafond, angled ~20–30° anteriorly, engaging 3 or 4 cortices depending on preference; failure modes include malreduction, screw breakage, overtightening, and late diastasis after removal. Suture-button: allows physiological micromotion and may reduce need for routine removal; useful in athletes and some high ankle sprains; failure modes include malreduction, soft-tissue interposition, button pull-through, and persistent instability if deltoid/medial side not addressed.",
      "explanation": "The viva trap is thinking the implant choice compensates for poor reduction—CT studies show malreduction is the dominant predictor of poor outcome regardless of device. Screw constructs can overconstrain if tightened in malposition; suture-buttons can “hold” a malreduced fibula just as well. Always prioritise anatomic reduction of the fibula in the incisura and confirm with fluoroscopy/CT where indicated.",

      "answer": "Weight-bearing: commonly protected/non-weight-bearing initially, then progress per fracture stability and soft tissues; early WB may be acceptable in selected stable constructs but avoid if concern about reduction/soft tissue. Screw removal: not routine; consider removal if symptomatic, if it blocks dorsiflexion, or in high-demand patients where breakage is problematic—typically after syndesmotic healing (~8–12 weeks) if chosen. Counsel: malreduction, loss of reduction, screw breakage, stiffness, heterotopic ossification/synostosis, and post-traumatic arthritis.",
      "explanation": "Routine removal is a classic viva trap—evidence does not mandate it, and removal carries infection/anaesthetic risks and can precipitate diastasis if done early. The bigger issue is ensuring the syndesmosis was anatomically reduced and remains so. Broken screws are often clinically irrelevant if the syndesmosis has healed; treat the patient, not the radiograph.",

      "answer": "Tibialis posterior dysfunction: pain/swelling posteromedial to medial malleolus, weakness of inversion, inability or pain on single-heel-rise with absent/poor hindfoot varus on rise, and “too many toes” sign. Spring ligament failure may present with medial arch collapse and talar head uncovering with less tendon tenderness/weakness; heel-rise may be preserved early. Management: tendon-driven disease may need tendon reconstruction/transfer plus osteotomies; isolated ligamentous collapse may require spring ligament reconstruction and alignment procedures, with tendon preserved if functional.",
      "explanation": "A common pitfall is assuming all adult flatfoot is tibialis posterior rupture; ligamentous attenuation (spring/deltoid) can be primary. Heel-rise assesses dynamic tibialis posterior function; preserved strength suggests the tendon is not the main driver. Imaging (US/MRI) can confirm tendon integrity, but alignment correction (hindfoot valgus/forefoot abduction) is often the decisive factor in surgical planning.",

      "answer": "ATFL/CFL insufficiency: positive anterior drawer (ATFL) and talar tilt (CFL), giving-way episodes, tenderness at ATFL/CFL footprints. Peroneal pathology: pain/swelling posterolateral, pain with resisted eversion, subluxation on circumduction, and tenderness along peroneal tendons/retromalleolar groove. Imaging: WB radiographs to assess alignment/osteochondral lesions; MRI for ligament/tendon/OLT assessment; ultrasound is excellent for dynamic peroneal subluxation.",
      "explanation": "The trap is treating “instability” with ligament repair when the main issue is peroneal tear/subluxation or cavovarus malalignment. Dynamic ultrasound can outperform MRI for peroneal instability.

      "question": "In an ankle fracture with suspected deltoid rupture, when (if ever) is primary deltoid repair indicated, and what is the key decision-making principle?",
      "answer": "Primary principle: restore anatomic mortise stability (fibular length/rotation, syndesmosis if unstable, and medial malleolus if fractured). Deltoid repair is not routine; consider it when there is persistent medial instability/MCS widening after bony and syndesmotic stabilisation, interposed deltoid preventing reduction, or in selected high-demand cases with clear medial incompetence. If the mortise is stable and reduced after standard fixation, deltoid repair is usually unnecessary.",
      "explanation": "A frequent viva error is equating MCS widening with mandatory deltoid repair—often the medial clear space normalises once the fibula and syndesmosis are anatomically reduced. Conversely, persistent widening after correct reduction suggests either malreduction (especially fibula in incisura) or true medial incompetence/interposition. The goal is a congruent mortise, not “repairing every torn ligament.”",

Key differentials: Baxter’s nerve entrapment, tarsal tunnel syndrome, calcaneal stress fracture, inflammatory enthesitis (e.g. seronegative), fat pad atrophy, and plantar fascia rupture.",
      "explanation": "The common trap is attributing all heel pain to plantar fasciitis and chasing heel spurs on X-ray; spurs are often incidental.

Counsel regarding limited number of injections, avoid injecting into the fat pad, use ultrasound guidance where available, and prioritise stretching/orthoses/activity modification first. If rupture occurs: treat with immobilisation, protected weight-bearing, and gradual rehab; avoid further steroid injections.",
      "explanation": "FRCS examiners often probe iatrogenic harm: fat pad atrophy can be more disabling than the original fasciitis and is difficult to treat.

      "answer": "Mechanism: sudden forced dorsiflexion with eversion (often with peroneal contraction) causing SPR tear and peroneal tendon subluxation/dislocation over the lateral malleolus. Key sign: painful snapping/visible subluxation of tendons with ankle circumduction or resisted eversion/dorsiflexion. Imaging: WB radiographs for avulsion (“fleck” sign) and alignment; MRI for tendon tears and groove morphology; dynamic ultrasound to confirm subluxation and assess tendon integrity.",
      "explanation": "The trap is diagnosing “lateral ligament sprain” and missing peroneal instability, leading to chronic symptoms and tendon tearing.

Key landmark: flexor retinaculum (laciniate ligament) from medial malleolus to calcaneus; release it and extend distally to decompress the medial and lateral plantar nerve tunnels under abductor hallucis fascia.",
      "explanation": "FRCS trap is stopping at the flexor retinaculum only; many failures are due to unrecognised distal entrapment of the medial/lateral plantar nerves beneath abductor hallucis.

      "explanation": "SPN emergence through fascia is variable; relying on a fixed distance from the malleolus is a viva trap. Marking reduces risk for arthroscopy portals, Broström, and anterolateral plating. Even when marked, branches can diverge—hence the importance of nick-and-spread.",

      "explanation": "Patients often accept numbness but not neuroma pain; consent should mention lateral foot sensory change for lateral hindfoot/midfoot incisions.

      "answer": "The tibial nerve typically divides into medial and lateral plantar nerves near/just distal to the tarsal tunnel, around the porta pedis beneath abductor hallucis; calcaneal branches may arise proximally or within the tunnel. This matters because distal entrapment under abductor hallucis fascia can persist if only the flexor retinaculum is released, and plantar incisions risk injuring these branches.",
      "explanation": "Branching variability is a classic viva trap—do not promise a single consistent pattern.

      "explanation": "Examiners want you to link wound site to source artery, but also to show you understand real-world constraints.

Relevance: dorsal approaches and retraction around the artery risk DPN injury causing first web space numbness and potential neuroma.",

      "answer": "Roof: flexor retinaculum (laciniate ligament). Floor: medial malleolus, talus/calcaneus and deep fascia over FDL/FHL. Contents (anteromedial → posterolateral): tibialis posterior tendon, flexor digitorum longus tendon, posterior tibial artery, posterior tibial veins, tibial nerve, flexor hallucis longus tendon (“Tom, Dick, And Very Nervous Harry”). Adequate decompression: release flexor retinaculum and extend distally to open the porta pedis (deep fascia of abductor hallucis) to decompress medial and lateral plantar nerves; consider decompression of calcaneal branches if symptomatic.",
      "explanation": "The common viva trap is stopping at the flexor retinaculum—persistent symptoms often come from distal entrapment under abductor hallucis (porta pedis). The neurovascular bundle lies between FDL and FHL; staying superficial and identifying the artery helps orient the nerve and avoid iatrogenic injury. Calcaneal branches can arise proximal to the tunnel and may be missed if the incision is too distal.

      "question": "During a medial malleolar/medial hindfoot approach, where is the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle in relation to the tendons, and what practical steps reduce the risk of iatrogenic injury?",
      "answer": "The posterior tibial artery/veins and tibial nerve lie posterior to FDL and anterior to FHL, immediately posterior to the medial malleolus within the tarsal tunnel. Risk reduction: keep dissection anterior to the bundle when working on the medial malleolus; identify and protect the saphenous vein/nerve anteriorly; use blunt dissection near the retinaculum; avoid deep posterior retractors; if extending distally, recognise the bifurcation into medial/lateral plantar nerves under abductor hallucis.",
      "explanation": "The key is tendon-based orientation: TP and FDL are safer anterior structures; the bundle is not “in the middle” but tucked posteriorly between FDL and FHL. Deep posterior retractors and aggressive periosteal elevation behind the medial malleolus are common causes of vascular/nerve injury.

      "answer": "The sural nerve runs with the small saphenous vein in the posterior-lateral leg, passes posterior to the lateral malleolus, then along the lateral border of the foot to the dorsolateral forefoot (lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve). High-risk: posterolateral ankle and lateral calcaneal wall/heel incisions (including extensile lateral approach) and peroneal tendon approaches. Mitigation: plan incision slightly more anterior where appropriate, identify and protect the nerve/vein in the subcutaneous layer, raise full-thickness flaps, avoid aggressive posterior retraction, and counsel regarding neuroma/dysaesthesia.",
      "explanation": "Sural nerve injury is a common and often underappreciated cause of chronic lateral foot pain after calcaneal surgery. The nerve is superficial and easily transected during skin incision or flap elevation; full-thickness flap technique reduces tethering and traction injury. A viva trap is confusing sural with superficial peroneal nerve—SPN is more anterior/dorsal, whereas sural is posterior to the lateral malleolus.

      "question": "For anterolateral ankle portals or distal fibula approaches, what is the clinically useful anatomy of the superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) and how do you locate it to avoid injury?",
      "answer": "SPN emerges from the lateral compartment to become subcutaneous in the distal third of the leg, then divides into medial and intermediate dorsal cutaneous branches supplying most of the dorsum of the foot (except first web space and lateral border). To locate: plantarflex and invert the foot to make the SPN/branches more visible; mark the nerve pre-op with this manoeuvre; use a small skin incision and blunt dissection for portals; keep distal fibula incisions mindful of variable branching anterior to the fibula.",
      "explanation": "SPN anatomy is variable—branching patterns and the point of fascial exit differ, so relying on fixed distances is a trap. Portal creation with a blade straight to capsule risks transection; blunt dissection down to capsule is safer. Sensory deficit over dorsum of foot or painful neuroma can be more disabling than expected and is a common litigation issue.

      "answer": "The DPN runs with the dorsalis pedis artery on the dorsum of the foot, typically lateral to the artery at the ankle and then crossing variably; both lie between extensor hallucis longus (EHL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) tendons. The common safe interval for dorsal midfoot exposure is between EHL and EDL, with careful identification and protection of the neurovascular bundle; alternatively, a more medial interval risks the saphenous vein/nerve and a more lateral interval risks SPN branches.",
      "explanation": "The viva trap is assuming the DPN is always lateral—its relationship to the artery can vary, so you must identify the bundle rather than “stay lateral”. Injury can cause first web space numbness (DPN) and compromised dorsal foot perfusion (dorsalis pedis), which matters in smokers/vasculopaths and in flap planning.

      "answer": "Angiosomes are 3D tissue territories supplied by specific source arteries. In the foot: posterior tibial artery supplies the plantar foot via medial and lateral plantar arteries (including much of the forefoot/plantar metatarsal heads); anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis supplies the dorsum; peroneal supplies the lateral ankle/heel (via calcaneal branches) and contributes to the plantar arch. For a plantar first metatarsal head ulcer, angiosome-directed revascularisation targets the posterior tibial artery (and plantar circulation) when feasible; indirect revascularisation via another artery may still work through collateral “choke” vessels but is less reliable in diabetics.",
      "explanation": "Angiosome-directed revascularisation can improve wound healing when collateral networks are poor (common in diabetes/renal disease). A trap is oversimplifying territories—there is overlap via the plantar arch and perforators, so clinical judgement and imaging (CTA/MRA/angiography) guide the best target.

Positive lateral distance = valgus; medial = varus. Pitfall: using a non-WB view or malpositioned limb (tibial rotation/foot progression angle) which falsely changes the apparent moment arm.",
      "explanation": "The hindfoot moment arm reflects where the calcaneus sits relative to the tibial load axis, which drives pronation/supination moments at the subtalar joint. Non-weight-bearing images under-estimate deformity and can miss flexible collapse. Rotational malalignment during imaging can mimic valgus/varus; ensure standardised stance and compare bilaterally.

      "answer": "Coleman block: stand with heel and lateral forefoot on a block, first ray unloaded. If hindfoot varus corrects to neutral/valgus, the varus is forefoot-driven (plantarflexed first ray) and treat the first ray (e.g., dorsiflexion 1st metatarsal osteotomy) ± soft tissue; if it remains varus, it is hindfoot-driven and needs calcaneal osteotomy (e.g., lateralising) or fusion depending on rigidity.",
      "explanation": "A plantarflexed first ray forces the hindfoot into compensatory varus to bring the medial forefoot to the ground. Unloading the first ray removes that driver; correction implies a flexible subtalar joint and forefoot-driven deformity.

      "explanation": "Heel rise couples ankle plantarflexion with subtalar inversion, converting the foot into a rigid lever for push-off. If the hindfoot stays in valgus, the midfoot remains unlocked and propulsion is inefficient; this correlates with progressive adult acquired flatfoot.

      "explanation": "In planovalgus, the heel is lateral to the tibial axis, increasing eversion moment and overloading tibialis posterior. Medialising the heel realigns the hindfoot under the tibia, improving the lever arm for inversion and reducing medial soft-tissue strain.

Lateralising translation: shifts the heel laterally under the tibia to reduce varus moment without necessarily changing calcaneal pitch/shape as much; often used when varus is more positional and subtalar joint is flexible.",
      "explanation": "Both aim to move the heel’s weight-bearing point laterally to reduce lateral column overload and improve ankle stability, but they do so differently. Dwyer is useful for structural varus of the calcaneus; translation is often simpler and preserves calcaneal height. Pitfall: overcorrection into valgus can cause medial overload and posterior tibial symptoms. Always reassess forefoot-driven components (plantarflexed first ray) to avoid persistent deforming forces.",

      "question": "Define first ray 'hypermobility' in practical terms and explain how it contributes to hallux valgus progression.",
      "answer": "Clinically: excessive dorsiflexion/instability at the first tarsometatarsal joint under load (often with plantar gapping/sag of the medial column). It allows the first metatarsal to drift medially and dorsiflex, reducing first MTP joint stability and increasing lateral deviation of the hallux via altered tendon pull and load transfer to the lesser metatarsals.",
      "explanation": "A stable plantarflexed first ray is needed for effective windlass and push-off. When the medial column is unstable, the first metatarsal elevates and the hallux deviates, worsening the deformity and transferring load laterally (metatarsalgia). Pitfall: labelling all hallux valgus as “hypermobility” without assessing TMT instability on WB imaging and exam; unnecessary Lapidus can cause nonunion/stiffness. Alternative driver: metatarsus primus varus without true instability—may be treated with distal/proximal metatarsal osteotomy depending on angles.",

      "answer": "A plantarflexed first metatarsal drives the forefoot into varus; to get the medial forefoot to the ground, the hindfoot compensates by inverting (varus). This shifts load laterally, increasing lateral ligament strain and promoting recurrent inversion sprains.",
      "explanation": "The foot seeks a plantigrade position; if the medial forefoot is too plantarflexed, the subtalar joint inverts to accommodate. This creates a lateralised ground reaction force and a supinated, rigid foot with poor shock absorption. Pitfall: correcting only the ankle instability (e.g., Broström) without addressing the cavovarus alignment leads to failure.

A Cotton (opening wedge plantarflexion osteotomy of the medial cuneiform) plantarflexes the first ray to restore a plantigrade forefoot and rebalance load across the forefoot.",
      "explanation": "Hindfoot correction alone can leave the medial forefoot off the ground, causing lateral overload and recurrence of deformity.

      "answer": "Reduced first MTP dorsiflexion prevents plantar fascia tensioning, limiting arch rise and efficient push-off. Patients may externally rotate the limb (abducted foot progression), load the lateral forefoot, or shorten stance phase to avoid terminal dorsiflexion pain.",
      "explanation": "Without windlass, the foot stays relatively flexible and propulsion shifts away from the first ray, increasing lesser metatarsal overload.

      "question": "Why does the position of the subtalar joint axis matter for pronation/supination, and how does a more medially deviated axis present clinically?",
      "answer": "The subtalar axis determines the lever arm of ground reaction force relative to the joint, influencing pronation/supination moments. A more medially deviated axis increases pronation moment (easier eversion), often associated with planovalgus, increased midfoot collapse, and difficulty resupinating during gait.",
      "explanation": "When the axis is medial, more of the plantar load lies lateral to it, generating an eversion torque. This can overwhelm tibialis posterior and intrinsic stabilisers, contributing to progressive flatfoot mechanics. Pitfall: assuming all flatfeet are purely “tendon problems”—bony alignment and axis position drive the mechanics and influence whether osteotomy/fusion is needed.

      "question": "How does subtalar axis position influence orthotic strategy (e.g., medial heel skive) in symptomatic pronation?",
      "answer": "With a medially deviated subtalar axis, greater supination moments are needed to counter pronation; a medial heel skive increases medial heel pressure to generate a supination moment at the subtalar joint. If the axis is more lateral, smaller orthotic changes may achieve control, and excessive medial posting risks overcorrection.",
      "explanation": "Orthoses work by shifting plantar pressure to create moments about the subtalar axis. A medial heel skive is specifically aimed at increasing the supination moment without bulky posting. Pitfall: prescribing aggressive medial posting in a rigid hindfoot or arthritic subtalar joint—pain increases without meaningful correction.

      "explanation": "Efficient propulsion requires a stiff medial column and locked midfoot; failure leads to prolonged pronation, midfoot collapse, and transfer metatarsalgia.

      "answer": "In pronation (hindfoot eversion), the axes of the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints become more parallel, increasing midfoot mobility (unlocked). In supination (hindfoot inversion), the axes become more convergent, reducing motion (locked) to create a rigid lever for push-off.",
      "explanation": "This coupling explains why persistent hindfoot valgus keeps the midfoot flexible and symptomatic (collapse, fatigue, pain). Pitfall: assuming midfoot pain always arises from midfoot arthritis—mechanical unlocking from hindfoot valgus can be the driver and may respond to hindfoot realignment/orthoses.

      "answer": "Varus tibiotalar wear may coexist with compensatory hindfoot valgus or fixed hindfoot varus; they are not interchangeable. Surgical planning (realignment osteotomy, TAA, or fusion) must restore the overall weight-bearing axis; a fixed hindfoot varus often needs calcaneal osteotomy/subtalar procedures in addition to addressing the ankle.",

It matters because procedures must target the correct apex: hindfoot valgus may need medialising calcaneal osteotomy/subtalar fusion; predominant forefoot abduction may need lateral column lengthening.",

Patients may increase motion through the midfoot/forefoot, externally rotate the limb for clearance, and have reduced stride length with lateral border overload depending on fixed alignment.",
      "explanation": "The subtalar joint is central to pronation-supination coupling; stiffness forces compensatory motion elsewhere, which can cause secondary midfoot arthritis or peroneal tendinopathy.

Use a true weight-bearing hindfoot alignment view (Saltzman) and correlate with clinical heel rise and forefoot position. Pitfalls: midfoot collapse can make the heel look more valgus; tibial malalignment and knee varus/valgus can confound; non–weight-bearing films underestimate deformity; rotational malpositioning alters apparent heel offset.",
      "explanation": "The hindfoot alignment view is intended to quantify the heel’s relationship to the tibia under load, which is what drives symptoms and tendon forces. If you plan a calcaneal osteotomy or fusion based on a malpositioned or non-WB image, you risk under- or over-correcting and creating lateral column overload or persistent medial pain. Always interpret alongside the Coleman block test (forefoot-driven vs hindfoot-driven) and the ability to correct on heel rise (flexible vs rigid).

      "answer": "Support the lateral forefoot and heel on a block while the first ray is allowed to drop off (unloaded). If the hindfoot varus corrects to neutral/valgus, the varus is forefoot-driven (plantarflexed first ray) and you prioritise first-ray correction (e.g. dorsiflexion 1st metatarsal osteotomy) ± soft tissue balancing; if hindfoot remains in varus, it is hindfoot-driven and you need a hindfoot procedure (e.g. lateralising calcaneal osteotomy or hindfoot fusion if rigid) in addition to addressing the forefoot as needed.",
      "explanation": "The test separates a compensatory hindfoot varus (secondary to a plantarflexed first ray) from a primary hindfoot varus, which is crucial because correcting the wrong segment leaves residual deformity and pain. A pitfall is placing the block under the whole forefoot (which falsely “corrects” by supporting the first ray) or performing it non–weight-bearing.

      "answer": "First-ray hypermobility is excessive dorsiflexion/instability at the first tarsometatarsal joint with reduced ability of the first ray to plantarflex and accept load during push-off, often associated with increased intermetatarsal angle and transfer metatarsalgia. It favours a Lapidus (1st TMT fusion) when there is symptomatic TMT instability/arthritis, large IMA, recurrent deformity risk, or when correction requires powerful IMA reduction and first-ray stabilisation; distal osteotomies are less suitable if instability is the driver.",
      "explanation": "Biomechanically, an unstable first ray fails to become a rigid lever in late stance, shifting load laterally and worsening lesser metatarsalgia; simply straightening the hallux can leave the underlying instability unaddressed. Viva traps include overcalling “hypermobility” without demonstrating true TMT instability (pain, dorsal translation, WB radiographic TMT gapping/arthritis) and ignoring that some apparent mobility is compensatory to hindfoot valgus.

      "answer": "Windlass: dorsiflexion of the hallux tensions the plantar fascia, elevates the medial longitudinal arch, and supinates the hindfoot to create a rigid lever for push-off. Test by dorsiflexing the hallux in weight-bearing (Jack’s test) and observing arch rise/heel inversion and symptom reproduction. Failure (little arch rise, persistent hindfoot valgus) suggests plantar fascia insufficiency or a pronated/flatfoot mechanism (often with tibialis posterior dysfunction or midfoot collapse), guiding treatment towards addressing hindfoot/midfoot alignment rather than isolated plantar fascia measures.",
      "explanation": "The windlass links first MTP motion to midfoot stiffness and hindfoot position; if it does not engage, the foot remains a flexible lever and overloads medial structures. A common pitfall is performing the test non–weight-bearing, which can appear normal despite functional collapse in stance.

      "answer": "The subtalar axis is an oblique axis through the talus/calcaneus about which inversion/eversion occurs; its orientation and medial/lateral position determine how ground reaction forces create pronation or supination moments. A more medially deviated axis increases pronation moments (tendency to hindfoot valgus/flatfoot), while a more laterally deviated axis increases supination moments (tendency to hindfoot varus/cavovarus). This helps explain why some feet are resistant to orthoses and why shifting the heel (calcaneal osteotomy) can change moments by relocating the calcaneus relative to the axis.",
      "explanation": "FRCS-level understanding is that deformity is not just “shape” but also the balance of moments around the subtalar axis during stance. If you ignore axis-driven mechanics, you may under-correct with soft tissue procedures or choose an orthosis that cannot overcome the prevailing moment. A viva trap is assuming subtalar motion equals ankle motion; subtalar-driven hindfoot malalignment can exist with preserved ankle ROM, and coalitions can mask motion yet still produce characteristic alignment and peroneal spasm.",

      "category": "Foundations > Biomechanics & Gait > Hindfoot correction principles",
      "question": "In a symptomatic planovalgus foot, what biomechanical goals distinguish a medialising calcaneal osteotomy from a subtalar fusion, and what clinical/radiographic features steer you to one over the other?",
      "answer": "Medialising calcaneal osteotomy repositions the heel under the tibia to reduce valgus moment and improve the Achilles/tibialis posterior lever arm while preserving subtalar motion; subtalar fusion eliminates painful/degenerate subtalar motion and provides powerful, durable correction but sacrifices inversion/eversion. Choose osteotomy when deformity is flexible with preserved subtalar joint and pain is mainly from tendon/soft tissue overload; choose fusion when deformity is rigid, there is subtalar arthritis, coalition, or failed prior reconstruction. WB radiographs and clinical hindfoot flexibility (heel rise, passive correction) are key discriminators.",
      "explanation": "The operative aim is to restore a plantigrade foot and efficient push-off: osteotomy changes alignment and moments; fusion changes both alignment and the joint’s contribution to gait. Pitfalls include performing an osteotomy in a rigid/arthritic subtalar joint (persistent pain, nonfunctional correction) or fusing without addressing forefoot supination/first-ray issues (residual forefoot-driven deformity and lateral overload). Salvage thinking: failed osteotomy with progressive arthritis often ends in subtalar or triple fusion; failed fusion with malalignment may require revision with realignment and attention to adjacent joint overload.",

      "answer": "Views: WB AP foot, WB lateral foot, hindfoot alignment view (Saltzman), and AP ankle mortise (if ankle symptoms/valgus). Measurements: (1) Meary’s angle (talo–1st metatarsal) on lateral: >4° apex plantar = pes planus. (2) Calcaneal pitch: <17° suggests planus. (3) Talonavicular coverage angle on AP: increased (often >7–10°) indicates forefoot abduction. (4) Hindfoot moment arm on Saltzman: valgus >10 mm lateral to tibial axis is abnormal (severity increases with mm).",
      "explanation": "WB films are essential because non-WB underestimates collapse and abduction. Meary’s angle and calcaneal pitch quantify sagittal plane collapse; talonavicular coverage captures transverse plane abduction; Saltzman quantifies coronal hindfoot valgus and is useful for planning calcaneal osteotomy vs arthrodesis.

      "answer": "HVA: angle between long axes of 1st metatarsal and proximal phalanx (normal <15°). IMA: angle between long axes of 1st and 2nd metatarsals (normal <9°). DMAA: angle between distal 1st metatarsal articular surface and 1st metatarsal axis (normal ~<10°). Rough planning: mild (HVA <20, IMA <11) distal osteotomy; moderate (HVA 20–40, IMA 11–16) scarf/proximal osteotomy; severe (HVA >40 or IMA >16, or TMT1 instability) consider Lapidus ± Akin; high DMAA may need distal metatarsal articular realignment.",
      "explanation": "These angles guide where correction should occur (distal vs proximal vs TMT1). A common viva trap is over-relying on HVA alone: IMA and TMT1 instability often dictate Lapidus.

      "question": "Which radiographic features on WB AP/lateral/oblique foot help you decide cheilectomy vs 1st MTP fusion in hallux rigidus?",
      "answer": "Cheilectomy is favoured when joint space is reasonably preserved (especially plantar), dorsal osteophytes predominate, and there is minimal sesamoid/plantar joint degeneration. 1st MTP fusion is favoured with diffuse joint space loss, plantar osteophytes/flattening, subchondral sclerosis/cysts, sesamoid arthritis, or significant deformity/instability. Oblique view helps assess dorsal/medial osteophytes and joint congruity.",
      "explanation": "Cheilectomy addresses dorsal impingement; it fails when arthritis is global (pain throughout arc, plantar degeneration). A trap is using only the AP view: plantar joint wear can be missed without a good lateral/oblique.

      "answer": "Use WB AP mortise and hindfoot alignment view: Tibial plafond angle (tibial axis vs plafond) indicates supramalleolar deformity; talar tilt (talar dome vs plafond) indicates intra-articular instability/ligament imbalance; Saltzman hindfoot moment arm indicates hindfoot-driven varus/valgus. It matters because supramalleolar osteotomy corrects plafond malalignment, whereas calcaneal osteotomy/subtalar procedures address hindfoot-driven deformity; arthroplasty/fusion planning depends on achieving a plantigrade, balanced ankle.",
      "explanation": "Treating the wrong level leads to persistent tilt and early failure (especially ankle replacement). A viva pitfall is ignoring hindfoot alignment: a “straight” mortise can coexist with significant hindfoot varus on Saltzman.

      "question": "Which radiographic parameters on AP/mortise ankle views suggest syndesmotic disruption, and what are the key limitations that should prompt CT or stress imaging?",
      "answer": "Suggestive parameters: increased tibiofibular clear space (>6 mm on AP/mortise), decreased tibiofibular overlap (<6 mm on AP or <1 mm on mortise), and increased medial clear space (>4 mm or > superior clear space). Limitations: rotation/beam angle can mimic abnormal overlap; isolated posterior syndesmotic injury may look normal; and deltoid injury can drive medial clear space without syndesmotic widening—consider WB comparison, stress views, or CT for incisura/fibular position.",
      "explanation": "Plain films are screening tests and are highly technique-dependent. A common trap is diagnosing syndesmotic injury from a single poorly positioned mortise.

      "question": "In an ankle fracture with suspected posterior malleolus involvement, what does CT add beyond XR, and which CT features most influence fixation strategy?",
      "answer": "CT defines fragment size, morphology (posterolateral, posteromedial, or two-part), articular impaction, and incisura involvement. Fixation strategy is influenced by: step-off/impaction, involvement of the fibular incisura (syndesmotic stability), and fragment orientation (amenable to posterior antiglide plate vs AP screws). CT also identifies loose osteochondral fragments requiring reduction.",
      "explanation": "Relying on lateral XR underestimates size and misses impacted plafond fragments. The viva trap is quoting a simple “>25% articular surface” rule; modern decision-making is morphology and stability (incisura) rather than size alone. Posterior approaches allow direct reduction of impacted fragments and restoration of the incisura.",

      "answer": "Use coronal CT through the posterior facet for Sanders classification (type II–IV based on number/location of fracture lines). Management/prognosis modifiers: posterior facet comminution (Sanders IV), sustentaculum involvement, calcaneocuboid joint extension, significant varus/valgus malalignment, and lateral wall blow-out with peroneal impingement. CT also guides approach (sinus tarsi vs extensile) and screw trajectories to the sustentaculum.",
      "explanation": "Sanders correlates with outcomes but does not capture all clinically relevant features (e.g., calcaneocuboid joint, tuberosity malalignment).

      "answer": "Rules: on AP, medial border of 2nd metatarsal aligns with medial border of intermediate cuneiform; on oblique, medial border of 4th metatarsal aligns with medial border of cuboid; on lateral, no dorsal step-off at TMT joints. Measurement: diastasis between 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases >2 mm or asymmetry vs contralateral suggests injury; “fleck sign” indicates Lisfranc ligament avulsion. If equivocal: obtain WB comparison views and/or CT for subtle fractures; MRI for purely ligamentous injury.",
      "explanation": "Non-WB films commonly miss purely ligamentous instability; WB or stress reveals diastasis.

      "answer": "Acute Charcot: periarticular/subchondral marrow oedema across multiple joints, microfractures, joint effusions, and relatively preserved skin/soft tissue without a contiguous ulcer tract. Osteomyelitis: focal marrow replacement contiguous with an ulcer/sinus, cortical breach, abscess, and more focal involvement (often forefoot). Pitfall: both can show marrow oedema—look for an ulcer-to-bone tract and distribution (periarticular multi-joint vs focal).",
      "explanation": "MRI is sensitive but not specific; clinical correlation (ulcer, systemic signs) is essential.

Rupture: focal discontinuity/tear, haematoma, and retraction with dynamic pain. Choose MRI if diagnosis is uncertain, symptoms are atypical (neurological/space-occupying lesion), to assess stress fracture or Baxter’s nerve entrapment, or for surgical planning in complex tears.",

MRI is better for fibrous/cartilaginous coalitions and associated marrow oedema. Classic XR signs: talar beak (talocalcaneal coalition), “C-sign” on lateral (talocalcaneal), and “anteater sign” on oblique (calcaneonavicular).",
      "explanation": "CT provides precise bony detail and is most useful pre-operatively.

      "answer": "Assess relative metatarsal lengths (parabola) on WB AP: a long/plantarflexed 2nd metatarsal (often with a relatively short 1st) predisposes to transfer metatarsalgia. Look for MTP subluxation, dorsal osteophytes, and callosity correlation. Surgical implications: consider Weil osteotomy/shortening for long metatarsal, address 1st ray insufficiency (e.g., 1st ray plantarflexion/realignment) rather than isolated lesser metatarsal surgery if transfer is primary.",
      "explanation": "Metatarsalgia is often biomechanical; treating only the painful ray can worsen transfer.

Associated findings: synovitis/effusion, collateral ligament attenuation, intermetatarsal bursitis, and metatarsal head marrow oedema. These influence whether soft-tissue repair alone is feasible or whether metatarsal shortening (e.g., Weil) is needed to reduce tension.",

Stress fracture: visible low-signal fracture line with surrounding marrow oedema, possibly cortical breach. Management: stress reaction may allow protected WB/activity modification; stress fracture often needs stricter immobilisation and WB restriction, especially in high-risk sites (navicular, 5th metatarsal base, anterior tibial cortex).",

Features favouring surgery: complete fracture through both cortices, displacement, established non-union/sclerosis, or failure of adequate non-operative treatment; CT also helps plan screw trajectory and assess union.",
      "explanation": "Navicular stress fractures are high-risk due to limited blood supply and central load.

      "answer": "Coleman block: place lateral forefoot on a block with 1st ray off; if hindfoot varus corrects to neutral/valgus, deformity is forefoot-driven (plantarflexed 1st ray); if varus persists, hindfoot-driven. Radiographic clue: increased Meary’s angle with plantarflexed 1st metatarsal (1st MT below talar axis) and often increased calcaneal pitch; look for 1st ray plantarflexion on lateral WB view.",

      "question": "Which radiographic angles on weight-bearing AP foot guide hallux valgus procedure selection, and what thresholds push you towards a proximal osteotomy or Lapidus rather than a distal chevron?",
      "answer": "Key angles: HVA (hallux valgus angle), IMA (1st–2nd intermetatarsal angle), and DMAA (distal metatarsal articular angle). Distal chevron typically for mild–moderate deformity (e.g., HVA <30° and IMA <13°). Consider proximal osteotomy or Lapidus when IMA is higher (commonly ≥13–15°) and/or there is 1st TMT instability/arthritis; high DMAA suggests need for distal articular correction (e.g., biplanar/rotational techniques) rather than relying on translation alone.",
      "explanation": "WB AP is mandatory because IMA and sesamoid position change with load. The trap is choosing a distal osteotomy for a high IMA or unstable TMT joint—recurrence risk is high. DMAA is frequently mismeasured if the metatarsal is pronated; consider WB CT or careful assessment of pronation/rotation when the clinical deformity seems worse than the AP angle suggests.",

      "question": "On mortise ankle radiographs, what are the key measurements for syndesmotic integrity and what are the common pitfalls that make them unreliable?",
      "answer": "Measurements: tibiofibular clear space (TFCS) and tibiofibular overlap (TFO) on mortise view; medial clear space (MCS) compared with superior clear space. Concerning: widened TFCS (often >6 mm), reduced/absent TFO, and MCS widening (especially >4 mm or >1 mm greater than superior clear space). Pitfalls: malrotation (not a true mortise), non-WB/supine films, fibular malreduction (length/rotation) masquerading as syndesmotic widening, and relying on a single parameter rather than the pattern and CT when in doubt.",
      "explanation": "These measurements are sensitive to positioning; a slightly oblique mortise can falsely reduce overlap and increase clear space. The exam trap is quoting numbers without acknowledging that they are technique-dependent and that CT is often required to assess fibular rotation in the incisura. Always interpret alongside fracture pattern (e.g., Weber C, Maisonneuve) and intra-op stress testing rather than radiographs alone.",

      "question": "What are the key alignment checks on weight-bearing AP/oblique foot radiographs for Lisfranc injury, and what single radiographic sign is most exam-relevant for instability?",
      "answer": "Alignment checks: AP—medial border of 2nd metatarsal aligns with medial border of intermediate cuneiform; oblique—medial border of 3rd metatarsal aligns with medial border of lateral cuneiform; assess diastasis between 1st–2nd metatarsal bases. Most exam-relevant sign of instability: widening between 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases (often >2 mm) or a “fleck sign” (avulsion fragment from Lisfranc ligament).",
      "explanation": "WB views (or stress views) reveal diastasis that can be occult on non-WB films. A common pitfall is ordering only ankle radiographs or accepting normal non-WB foot films—missed Lisfranc leads to midfoot collapse and arthritis.

Limitation: moderate interobserver reliability and it does not by itself dictate approach or outcome; soft-tissue condition, tuberosity varus/shortening, and overall morphology matter as much as the facet split.",
      "explanation": "Sanders helps communicate posterior facet comminution and can correlate with prognosis, but it is not a surgical plan.

      "answer": "CT is mandatory when: high-energy mechanism, equivocal displacement on XR, suspected subtalar/tibiotalar incongruity, or to plan fixation. CT defines: true displacement/rotation, comminution, subtalar joint involvement, medial neck impaction, and associated process fractures—information that determines need for open reduction, approach selection, and screw trajectory.",
      "explanation": "Plain radiographs frequently underestimate talar neck rotation and subtalar malalignment. The viva trap is treating a “minimally displaced” fracture non-operatively without CT—missed malreduction leads to arthritis and avascular necrosis risk is tied to displacement.

      "answer": "MRI: best for cartilage integrity, bone marrow oedema, and assessing lesion stability (fluid undermining, cysts, displaced fragment) and associated soft-tissue pathology. CT: best for defining bony architecture—size, depth, cystic change, and containment—useful for surgical planning (microfracture vs grafting) and for postoperative bony assessment. MRI is generally best for predicting stability; CT is best for bony detail.",
      "explanation": "A common pitfall is relying on MRI alone for sizing—MRI can overestimate due to oedema; CT gives the true osseous defect. Conversely, CT can miss cartilage delamination and early unstable lesions. In viva, link imaging to treatment: small contained stable lesions may be managed conservatively; large cystic/uncontained lesions often need restorative procedures.",

Rupture: focal discontinuity/tear with hypoechoic gap or haematoma, loss of normal fibrillar pattern, and dynamic pain with compression; often a history of sudden “pop” (sometimes post-steroid injection).",
      "explanation": "US is quick, dynamic, and can guide injections while avoiding intrafascial injection (rupture risk).

      "answer": "Use a weight-bearing hindfoot alignment view (e.g., Saltzman) to quantify calcaneal position relative to the tibial axis (hindfoot valgus/varus) and assess subtalar alignment. Advantage: it directly measures coronal hindfoot alignment under load, which standard foot AP/lateral views infer poorly and can miss true hindfoot varus/valgus driving the deformity.",
      "explanation": "This view guides whether a calcaneal osteotomy is needed and in which direction, and helps avoid correcting only the midfoot/forefoot.

      "answer": "MRI Charcot features: periarticular/subchondral marrow oedema across multiple joints, fragmentation/subluxation, relatively preserved skin envelope, and oedema centred on joints rather than a focal marrow signal contiguous with an ulcer. Osteomyelitis more likely with a sinus/ulcer tract to bone, focal marrow replacement at a pressure point, and adjacent soft-tissue abscess. Trap: diagnosing osteomyelitis from marrow oedema alone—must correlate with presence/location of ulcer and inflammatory markers.",
      "explanation": "Early Charcot can have normal XRs; MRI is sensitive but not specific without clinical context.

      "answer": "Give IV antibiotics immediately (ideally within 1 hour of injury/presentation) and do not wait for theatre. Use broad Gram-positive cover for all (e.g. IV co-amoxiclav; if penicillin allergy: IV clindamycin), add Gram-negative cover for higher-grade/contaminated wounds (e.g. gentamicin per local policy), and add metronidazole for farm/soil/faecal contamination. Continue until definitive soft-tissue coverage/closure (commonly 24–72 h depending on grade and policy), not for arbitrary long courses. Give tetanus prophylaxis as indicated.",
      "explanation": "Early antibiotics reduce infection risk more than any single later step; delaying until debridement is a classic trap. Spectrum should match contamination and grade; farm injuries need anaerobic cover. Overlong courses increase C. difficile and resistance and do not compensate for inadequate debridement. Another pitfall is forgetting tetanus status and not documenting time antibiotics were given.",

Re-dose intra-op if prolonged surgery/major blood loss per policy; no routine post-op doses beyond 24 hours.",
      "explanation": "If the tourniquet is inflated before antibiotics, tissue levels distal to the cuff may be inadequate—an easy viva trap.

Use standard single-dose IV prophylaxis; do not extend antibiotics to compensate for poor soft tissues.",
      "explanation": "Calcaneal wounds fail mainly due to soft-tissue biology and flap compromise, not lack of antibiotic duration.

Consider adding Gram-negative cover if indicated by policy; avoid routine prolonged post-op antibiotics.",
      "explanation": "The key is appropriate MRSA-active prophylaxis and correct timing—vancomycin must be infused early enough to achieve tissue levels before incision and before tourniquet inflation.

Perform formal VTE risk assessment (patient factors: prior VTE, cancer, thrombophilia, obesity, oestrogen therapy, age, reduced mobility; bleeding risk).

Encourage early mobilisation of the patient (upper limb/contralateral limb) and hydration.",
      "explanation": "There is variation in guidance for isolated below-knee surgery, so the viva is about structured risk assessment and justification.

      "answer": "Likely neurapraxia from tourniquet pressure/time, positioning, or regional block-related neuropraxia; less commonly compartment syndrome or haematoma. Document a focused neurovascular exam, check dressings/cast tightness, assess pain/swelling, and escalate urgently if concern for compartment syndrome. If isolated neuropraxia suspected, reassure, arrange follow-up and consider neurophysiology if not improving; document tourniquet time/pressure and anaesthetic details.",
      "explanation": "The key is not to dismiss new deficits as “just the block” without assessment. Compartment syndrome can present with neuro deficits and pain—missing it is catastrophic. Documentation of tourniquet parameters and serial exams protects the patient and you medico-legally.",

      "answer": "Delay definitive surgery until soft tissues recover (wrinkle sign), elevate, and use protective non-adherent dressings. Avoid incising through tense haemorrhagic blisters if possible; if surgery is urgent, plan incisions to avoid blister beds and consider temporising external fixation. Do not deroof blisters routinely; manage them as partial-thickness burns.",

Optimise: hold/review anticoagulants with medical input, apply compression/immobilisation appropriately, elevate, and consider incisional NPWT. Return to theatre for washout/haematoma evacuation if there is expanding haematoma, wound edge compromise, suspected deep infection, or ongoing bleeding not settling with optimisation.",
      "explanation": "Persistent ooze increases infection risk and can herald haematoma under tension. The trap is repeatedly changing dressings without addressing anticoagulation or haematoma. Early decisive washout is preferable to delayed dehiscence with exposed metalwork.",

If deep infection suspected: urgent surgical washout and debridement with multiple deep tissue samples (before antibiotics if stable), retain stable implants if fracture not united and fixation is sound, and start empiric IV antibiotics after sampling tailored to cultures with microbiology input. Avoid giving repeated oral antibiotics without source control or without obtaining cultures.",
      "explanation": "Early deep infection can often be managed with DAIR (debridement, antibiotics, implant retention) if fixation is stable; removing metalwork risks loss of reduction/nonunion.

      "answer": "Give IV antibiotics immediately (do not wait for theatre): typically IV co-amoxiclav 1.2 g 8-hourly; if penicillin allergy use IV clindamycin (e.g. 600–900 mg) ± gentamicin per local policy. Add high-dose IV benzylpenicillin if farm/soil contamination (concern for clostridial species). Continue for 24 hours after wound closure (or 72 hours after injury if delayed closure) per local open fracture protocol; take deep tissue samples at debridement but do not delay antibiotics to obtain cultures. Ensure tetanus status addressed and early combined ortho/plastics plan for definitive soft-tissue cover.",
      "explanation": "The exam trap is delaying antibiotics for imaging, transfer, or cultures—time to antibiotics is a key modifiable factor for infection. Co-amoxiclav provides broad Gram-positive/negative and anaerobic cover suitable for most UK open fractures; clindamycin is a common alternative in true penicillin allergy. Another pitfall is prolonged “just in case” antibiotics: duration should be protocol-driven and linked to closure, not arbitrary.

      "question": "For elective foot/ankle surgery with implants (e.g. TTC nail or hindfoot fusion), how do you choose peri-operative prophylactic antibiotics in a patient with MRSA colonisation or severe penicillin allergy?",
      "answer": "Standard prophylaxis is IV cefuroxime (or cefazolin where used) within 60 minutes of incision (repeat if prolonged surgery/major blood loss). If MRSA colonised/high risk: use IV teicoplanin or vancomycin (start infusion early to complete before incision) ± additional Gram-negative cover per local policy. In severe penicillin allergy: use IV clindamycin; if MRSA risk, prefer teicoplanin/vancomycin. Redose intra-op if duration exceeds 2 half-lives or significant blood loss; stop within 24 hours.",
      "explanation": "The key decision is matching cover to likely organisms (skin flora) and patient risk (MRSA, allergy) while hitting the correct timing window. A common pitfall is starting vancomycin at knife-to-skin—infusion must be completed before incision to achieve tissue levels and avoid red-man reactions. Another trap is continuing antibiotics for days “because there’s metal”; evidence supports short prophylaxis unless treating established infection.

      "question": "After ankle fracture ORIF with postoperative non-weight-bearing, how do you decide on VTE prophylaxis (mechanical vs LMWH/DOAC) in UK practice, and what factors push you to chemoprophylaxis?",
      "answer": "Use a formal VTE risk assessment (e.g. NICE) balancing VTE risk vs bleeding. Provide mechanical prophylaxis (TED stockings/IPC) unless contraindicated, and consider LMWH for patients with increased risk and reduced mobility (e.g. prolonged non-weight-bearing, previous VTE, active cancer, thrombophilia, obesity, oestrogen therapy, significant comorbidity). Duration is typically until mobility restored/weight-bearing or for the period of immobilisation, guided by local policy. DOACs are not routine for below-knee trauma in many UK units; if used, ensure indication, renal function, and bleeding risk are appropriate.",
      "explanation": "Foot and ankle surgery sits in a grey zone: the viva expects a risk-stratified approach rather than blanket anticoagulation. The common trap is ignoring the additive risk of strict non-weight-bearing and cast immobilisation, especially in high-risk patients.

      "answer": "Suspect with escalating pain out of proportion, pain on passive toe movement, tense swollen foot, paraesthesia; pulses may be present. Immediately remove constrictive dressings/splints, keep limb at heart level (not elevated high), provide analgesia, and urgently involve senior surgeon/anaesthetics. Measure compartment pressures if diagnosis is uncertain or patient is obtunded; use delta pressure (diastolic BP − compartment pressure) ≤ 30 mmHg as a threshold to fasciotomy. Proceed to urgent multi-compartment foot fasciotomies when clinical diagnosis is clear—do not delay for imaging.",
      "explanation": "The viva trap is relying on pulses or waiting for neurological deficit—these are late/unreliable signs. Foot compartment syndrome can be subtle and is commonly missed after calcaneal and midfoot injuries; pain on passive stretch and increasing analgesic requirement are key. Pressure measurement is an adjunct, particularly in sedated/polytrauma patients, but should not delay decompression when the clinical picture is convincing.

      "answer": "Use the lowest effective pressure (ideally based on limb occlusion pressure); commonly ~250 mmHg for thigh in adults, adjusted for systolic BP and cuff size. Aim to keep inflation time < 90–120 minutes; if longer is required, deflate for a reperfusion interval (e.g. 10–15 minutes) before reinflation. Use a wide, well-padded cuff, avoid placement over bony prominences, document inflation/deflation times, and ensure adequate anaesthetic monitoring. Be cautious in severe peripheral vascular disease, sickle cell disease, and significant neuropathy.",
      "explanation": "Excess pressure and prolonged time increase risk of nerve palsy, muscle injury, postoperative pain, and thrombotic risk; wide cuffs reduce required pressure. A common trap is using a fixed high pressure for all patients without considering cuff width, limb size, or blood pressure. Another pitfall is forgetting to document tourniquet time—this is frequently scrutinised in complications and medicolegal review.

      "answer": "Optimise glycaemic control, assess vascular status (palpable pulses are insufficient—consider ABPI/toe pressures and vascular referral if concerns), minimise soft-tissue trauma, ensure tension-free closure, and use offloading/appropriate postoperative footwear or cast. Avoid excessive tourniquet time and ensure meticulous haemostasis to reduce haematoma. Red flags for infection: increasing erythema, warmth, purulent discharge, systemic features, rising CRP/WCC; red flags for ischaemia: increasing pain, pallor/coolness, delayed capillary refill, dusky wound edges, blistering/necrosis with relatively low inflammatory markers.",
      "explanation": "Diabetic wound failure is often multifactorial—neuropathy and vasculopathy drive breakdown even with technically sound surgery. The viva trap is equating palpable pulses with adequate perfusion; toe pressures and clinical skin perfusion are more informative in diabetics with calcified vessels. Early differentiation matters: infection needs prompt antibiotics/source control, whereas ischaemia needs urgent vascular assessment and may worsen with aggressive debridement.

      "answer": "Remove/split the cast and inspect the wound; assess neurovascular status and swelling, elevate, and apply a well-padded splint or removable boot to allow monitoring. Manage blisters with non-adherent dressings; avoid deroofing unless necessary for dressing adherence, and keep the wound clean/dry. Start antibiotics only if there are clinical signs of infection; obtain inflammatory markers and consider imaging if deep infection suspected. Return to theatre for wound dehiscence with exposed metal, spreading cellulitis with systemic features, suspected deep infection/collection, or compromised fixation; consider washout, deep cultures, and staged management (including negative pressure therapy and plastics input if needed).",
      "explanation": "The common trap is leaving a tight cast in place and treating blindly with antibiotics—both delay recognition of evolving soft-tissue compromise. Fracture blisters reflect severe soft-tissue injury; aggressive handling increases breakdown risk, so protective dressings and close review are key. Deep infection after ORIF is a surgical diagnosis: persistent drainage, systemic upset, or exposed hardware generally requires operative washout and cultures rather than prolonged oral antibiotics.

      "answer": "Instability is suggested by MCS > 4 mm and/or MCS greater than the superior clear space (tibial plafond–talar dome) on a true mortise view (often using ≥1 mm difference as abnormal). Pitfall: measuring on a non-true mortise or non-WB view (rotation/plantarflexion) can falsely widen MCS; ensure talus is centred and compare to superior clear space.",
      "explanation": "MCS widening reflects deltoid incompetence and talar shift, which drives poor outcomes if treated non-operatively. A true mortise (15–20° internal rotation) is essential; malrotation exaggerates clear spaces.

      "explanation": "The deep deltoid is the key medial stabiliser; superficial deltoid injury alone may not destabilise the mortise.

Examine the entire fibula and obtain full-length tibia/fibula radiographs; assess medial clear space and posterior malleolus on ankle views/CT.",
      "explanation": "The viva trap is focusing on the ankle radiograph and missing the proximal fibula fracture, leading to untreated syndesmotic instability.

      "explanation": "Fragment size alone is an unreliable surrogate for instability; CT often shows comminution and impaction not seen on plain films.

These dictate approach (posterolateral/posteromedial), need for buttress plating, and whether posterior fixation can substitute for syndesmotic fixation.",
      "explanation": "CT is primarily for posterior malleolus and incisura assessment; it reduces missed impaction and guides reduction strategy.

Choose a posterior antiglide plate when the fracture is more distal/short oblique with posterior displacement tendency, in osteoporotic bone, or when you want stronger buttress and less prominent lateral hardware.",
      "explanation": "Neutralisation plating protects the lag screw from torsion and bending.

Fixation principle: address medial vertical shear with buttress plating (or antiglide) and restore articular congruity; assess for plafond impaction needing elevation/bone graft.",
      "explanation": "SAD injuries behave like partial pilon patterns medially; failure to buttress the vertical medial fragment leads to displacement and arthritis.

      "category": "Trauma > Ankle fractures > Syndesmosis fixation",
      "question": "When would you choose a suture-button device over a syndesmotic screw, and what complications must you counsel about?",
      "answer": "Choose suture-button when you want dynamic fixation (athletes, need for earlier functional rehab, concern about screw breakage/removal) and when reduction is anatomic. Complications: soft-tissue irritation, osteolysis, button migration, loss of reduction if poorly placed, and medial neurovascular irritation if the medial button is prominent.",
      "explanation": "Dynamic fixation may reduce need for routine removal and allow physiological micromotion, but it does not compensate for poor reduction. Viva trap: assuming suture-button eliminates the need for careful clamp reduction and imaging checks. Consider adding a second device or screw in high-energy/unstable patterns.",

      "question": "What is your FRCS-level approach to weight-bearing and routine removal after syndesmotic screw fixation?",
      "answer": "Do not remove routinely if asymptomatic; remove selectively for pain, restricted dorsiflexion, or if screw position compromises function. Weight-bearing is commonly delayed until early healing (often ~6 weeks) depending on fracture stability and fixation; protected WB may be allowed with intact fixation and good reduction, accepting risk of screw breakage which is often clinically benign.",
      "explanation": "Evidence does not support mandatory routine removal; removal adds anaesthetic and wound risks. The key is maintaining reduction while fractures heal; screw breakage alone is not an indication for surgery.

      "question": "In an ankle fracture with medial clear space widening, when is deltoid ligament repair indicated and when is it unnecessary?",
      "answer": "Usually unnecessary if anatomic fibular (and posterior malleolar) reduction restores mortise congruity and MCS normalises. Consider repair if persistent medial instability/widening after bony fixation and syndesmotic management, if there is interposed deltoid preventing reduction, or in selected high-demand cases with clear medial incompetence despite stable bony reconstruction.",
      "explanation": "Most medial widening resolves once lateral column length/rotation and syndesmosis are restored; repairing deltoid routinely risks overtreatment.

      "answer": "1) Confirm true mortise fluoroscopy and check fibular length/rotation (compare to incisura, Shenton-like line, talar centring). 2) Assess posterior malleolus/incipura reduction (fix posterior fragment if indicated). 3) Perform syndesmosis stress testing; if unstable, reduce with clamp and fix (screw/suture-button). 4) If mortise still incongruent, suspect deltoid interposition or medial malleolus malreduction and explore/repair as needed.",
      "explanation": "Persistent MCS widening is more often malreduction or unaddressed syndesmotic/posterior pathology than a primary need for deltoid repair.

      "answer": "On mortise: assess tibiofibular overlap/clear space and that the fibula sits concentrically in the incisura without lateral translation. On lateral: check fibula is not posteriorly translated and that the posterior malleolus/Volkmann fragment aligns. Use direct visualisation/CT if concern persists; compare with contralateral ankle if available.",
      "explanation": "Even small rotational errors alter contact pressures and lead to pain/arthritis.

Definitive ORIF is delayed until soft tissues permit (wrinkle sign), with CT for planning once reduced.",
      "explanation": "Soft-tissue preservation drives outcome; attempting definitive ORIF through compromised skin increases infection and wound breakdown.

Salvage: CT to assess reduction; revision syndesmosis reduction with debridement and fixation (often suture-button ± screw) and address posterior malleolus/incipura; if established arthritis, consider ankle arthrodesis (or arthroplasty in selected cases).",

      "explanation": "PER injuries are typically unstable because the medial side fails early and the interosseous membrane/syndesmosis are frequently disrupted, often with a higher fibular fracture.

      "explanation": "WB views are functional and avoid overcalling instability from painful stress tests; they show whether the talus remains centred under physiological load.

      "answer": "MCS assesses deltoid/talar shift (instability if widened as above). Tibiofibular clear space (>6 mm on AP/mortise) and reduced tibiofibular overlap (<6 mm AP, <1 mm mortise) suggest syndesmotic disruption. Pitfalls: malrotation (non-true mortise), plafond tilt, and relying on single parameter—compare with contralateral side if uncertain.",
      "explanation": "Syndesmotic measures are sensitive to positioning; a slightly internally/externally rotated mortise can mimic abnormal overlap.

Size alone is insufficient; CT morphology guides.",

Suture-button: allows physiological motion, less routine removal; failure modes include soft tissue irritation, osteolysis, loss of reduction if malpositioned or in severe instability (may need augmentation).",

      "question": "What is your FRCS-level approach to syndesmotic screw removal and weight-bearing advice, and what are the viva traps?",
      "answer": "Routine removal is not mandatory; remove if symptomatic (pain, restricted dorsiflexion), if screw blocks planned early high-demand motion, or if prominent/loosening. Weight-bearing protocols vary; commonly protected weight-bearing until fracture healing and syndesmotic stability is secure, with earlier WB more acceptable with suture-button constructs. Trap: insisting all screws must be removed before weight-bearing—evidence is mixed and practice should be individualised.",
      "explanation": "Many screws break without clinical consequence if reduction is maintained; unnecessary removal adds anaesthetic and infection risk. Conversely, early unprotected WB in an unstable pattern risks loss of reduction. Another pitfall: failing to counsel that screw breakage can occur and is not automatically a complication requiring surgery.",

      "answer": "Supination–adduction (SA). Key principle: medial malleolus is a vertical shear fracture—requires buttress plating (or antiglide/neutralisation construct) rather than screws alone; address lateral impaction/compression as needed.",
      "explanation": "SA injuries create a vertical medial fracture that tends to displace under shear during weight-bearing; compression screws alone may not resist this. Pitfall: treating as a simple medial malleolus fracture with two screws and accepting subtle varus tilt—this predisposes to malunion and arthritis. Consider CT to assess plafond impaction.",

      "answer": "If malreduction/diastasis is the driver and joint surfaces are salvageable: revision syndesmotic reduction (often CT-guided), debridement, and stabilisation (screw/suture-button) ± fibular osteotomy/lengthening if shortened. If established painful arthritis: ankle arthrodesis (tibiotalar) ± syndesmotic fusion; in selected cases, total ankle replacement is rarely appropriate post-trauma with instability/malalignment. Decision factors: degree of arthritis, alignment, bone stock, infection risk, patient demands.",
      "explanation": "Early recognition allows joint-preserving revision; once cartilage loss is advanced, stabilising the syndesmosis alone won’t relieve pain.

      "explanation": "Many Weber B fractures are stable if the deep deltoid is intact; WB views are preferred because they reflect functional stability and reduce false positives seen with stress tests.

      "answer": "No—medial tenderness/bruising are unreliable. Use mortise congruency on WB radiographs (preferred) or stress imaging (gravity/external rotation) to assess MCS and talar shift.",
      "explanation": "A common viva trap is equating medial pain with instability; superficial deltoid injury can be painful without deep deltoid incompetence.

It prompts careful assessment of posterior malleolus and medial side even if not obvious on initial films.",
      "explanation": "Lauge-Hansen is most useful as a checklist for occult components rather than a perfect classifier.

      "answer": "Features: medial injury first (medial malleolus fracture or deltoid rupture), syndesmotic disruption, and a higher fibula fracture (often above the syndesmosis; Weber C pattern). It matters because syndesmotic instability is more likely and requires deliberate assessment and often fixation; also consider proximal fibula (Maisonneuve) and interosseous membrane injury.",
      "explanation": "PER injuries commonly have global instability; treating only the fibula without addressing syndesmosis/medial side risks diastasis and malreduction. A full-length tibia/fibula radiograph is essential if a high fibula fracture or medial clear space widening is present. The fixation plan often includes syndesmotic stabilisation and, when present, medial malleolus fixation.",

      "answer": "Obtain full-length tibia/fibula radiographs (knee to ankle) plus ankle mortise views; consider CT for posterior malleolus. Key principle: you usually do not fix the proximal fibula—stabilise the ankle by addressing the syndesmosis (and posterior malleolus/medial injury as indicated).",
      "explanation": "The proximal fibula fracture is a marker of interosseous membrane disruption and syndesmotic instability.

      "answer": "Indications include: posterior talar subluxation/step, articular incongruity (>2 mm step), involvement of the incisura affecting syndesmotic reduction, large or displaced fragment, and PITFL avulsion contributing to instability. Fixing the posterior malleolus can restore PITFL tension and may reduce or eliminate the need for a syndesmotic screw.",
      "explanation": "The classic “>25–30%” rule is a viva trap; CT-defined morphology and stability are more important. Posterior malleolus fixation improves rotational stability and helps achieve an anatomic incisura, which is critical for syndesmotic reduction.

      "answer": "Choose posterolateral approach when the fragment is displaced, involves the posterolateral plafond/incisura, is comminuted, or requires buttress plating/direct reduction. Protect the sural nerve and small saphenous vein; be mindful of the peroneal tendons and FHL interval.",
      "explanation": "Percutaneous AP screws risk capturing only a portion of an oblique fragment and can malreduce the incisura.

      "answer": "Preferred: interfragmentary lag screw(s) perpendicular to the fracture line plus a neutralisation plate (usually lateral). This provides compression for primary bone healing and protects the lag screw from torsional/bending forces.",
      "explanation": "A bridging plate alone may not achieve compression and can allow subtle shortening/rotation, risking mortise widening.

      "explanation": "An antiglide plate acts as a buttress; it can be particularly useful when distal fragment is small or bone quality is poor.

      "answer": "Use two parallel partially threaded cancellous screws for most transverse/oblique fractures with adequate fragment size; use tension band wiring for small, osteoporotic, or avulsion-type fragments. Ensure anatomic reduction with compression across the fracture and avoid interposed periosteum; place screws perpendicular to the fracture line.",

      "answer": "Use the hook (Cotton) test with lateral pull on the distal fibula under mortise fluoroscopy, and/or external rotation stress test. A positive test is abnormal widening of the tibiofibular clear space/overlap or medial clear space widening compared with the contralateral side/expected norms, indicating diastasis or malreduction.",
      "explanation": "Testing before restoring fibular length/rotation can give misleading results; fix the fibula first.

Prerequisite: anatomic reduction of the fibula in the incisura with restored length/rotation and a reduced mortise.",
      "explanation": "A syndesmotic screw will hold whatever position you put it in—fixing a malreduced syndesmosis is a classic viva pitfall.

Disadvantages: risk of soft-tissue irritation, osteolysis, medial button problems, and it does not correct malreduction. Avoid/consider caution in severe comminution, poor bone stock, gross instability needing rigid control, or when medial soft tissues are compromised.",
      "explanation": "A viva trap is claiming suture-buttons “guarantee” reduction—they do not; reduction must be achieved first.

Routine repair for medial tenderness alone is not indicated.",
      "explanation": "Most deltoid injuries heal without repair if the mortise is anatomically reduced.

      "explanation": "Jumping straight to deltoid repair is a common trap; most persistent widening is due to fibular malreduction or unaddressed posterior malleolus/incisura issues.

Minimise by restoring fibular length/rotation first, placing clamp tines correctly (often anterolateral fibula to posteromedial tibia), checking mortise and true lateral (or 3D imaging), and fixing posterior malleolus/incisura when it affects reduction.",
      "explanation": "Malreduction can occur even when the mortise “looks OK” on one view; the lateral view is crucial for anterior–posterior translation.

Routine screw removal is not mandatory; consider removal if symptomatic, restricting dorsiflexion, or before high-demand activity depending on construct and local practice. Counsel that screw breakage is common and often asymptomatic; the priority is maintained reduction and function.",
      "explanation": "Dogmatic “always remove at X weeks” is a viva trap; evidence and practice vary.

      "question": "In an isolated Weber B (SER) fibular fracture, which radiographic findings define an unstable injury needing operative stabilisation, and what is the key imaging pitfall?",
      "answer": "Unstable if there is talar shift: medial clear space (MCS) > superior clear space and typically >4 mm on a true mortise view, or widening on stress (gravity/external rotation) or WB mortise radiographs. Any lateral talar shift is significant. Pitfall: measuring MCS on a non-true mortise/AP with rotation or poor reduction—can falsely widen or mask widening; always assess on a true mortise and compare to superior clear space.",
      "explanation": "The decision to operate hinges on whether the talus is centred in the mortise; even small talar shift markedly increases contact pressures and arthritis risk. SER injuries can look “isolated fibula” but actually have deep deltoid disruption—stress or WB views reveal this. A common viva trap is quoting an absolute MCS number without stating it must be on a true mortise and compared to the superior clear space; also remember that a well-reduced fibula does not guarantee a stable mortise if the talus remains shifted.",

      "question": "After fibular fixation in a Weber C (PER) ankle fracture, how do you decide whether to fix the syndesmosis, and what intra-operative steps reduce malreduction risk?",
      "answer": "Fix the syndesmosis if it remains unstable after anatomic fibular length/rotation restoration: positive hook (Cotton) test with lateral translation, persistent tibiofibular clear space widening or reduced tibiofibular overlap on mortise, or obvious instability on direct visualisation. Reduce with the ankle in neutral dorsiflexion, restore fibular length/rotation first, confirm reduction with fluoroscopy (including true mortise and lateral) and ideally compare with the contralateral side or use intra-op 3D/CT if available. Place fixation 2–4 cm above the plafond, aiming from fibula to tibia, avoiding overcompression and malrotation.",
      "explanation": "In PER injuries the syndesmosis is commonly disrupted, but the key principle is that many “instabilities” disappear once the fibula is anatomically reduced—so test after fibular ORIF. Malreduction (especially fibular external rotation/shortening) is the major cause of poor outcomes; clamps can create iatrogenic malposition if applied obliquely or overcompressed. A viva trap is fixing the syndesmosis without first restoring fibular length (often requiring a plate as a reduction tool) or relying on a single fluoroscopic view.",

      "question": "For syndesmotic fixation in ankle fractures, compare screw versus suture-button constructs in terms of indications, technique essentials, and common FRCS pitfalls (including weight-bearing and screw removal).",
      "answer": "Screws: reliable, cheap; typically 3.5 or 4.5 mm, 1–2 screws engaging 3 or 4 cortices, placed 2–4 cm above plafond, with ankle in neutral dorsiflexion; consider 4-cortex in high-demand/poor bone, but avoid overcompression. Suture-button: allows physiological micromotion and may reduce need for routine removal; useful in athletes or when avoiding a second procedure, but requires accurate reduction and can irritate soft tissues or fail if malpositioned. WB: usually protected WB until fracture stability allows; do not base WB solely on implant type. Removal: routine syndesmosis screw removal is not mandatory; remove if symptomatic, broken with pain, or if it blocks dorsiflexion/return to sport—avoid early removal before ligament healing.",
      "explanation": "The exam focus is decision-making and avoiding dogma: both constructs fail if the syndesmosis is malreduced. Over-tightening a clamp or screw can overcompress and malrotate the fibula, causing pain and stiffness. Another trap is stating all screws must be removed at 6 weeks—evidence is mixed and practice is individualised; the key is symptom-driven removal and ensuring adequate healing time before removal if done.",

      "question": "When (if ever) should you explore/repair the deltoid ligament in acute ankle fracture ORIF, and what are the practical intra-operative indicators?",
      "answer": "Do not routinely repair. Consider deltoid exploration/repair if, after anatomic fibular fixation (and posterior malleolus addressed if indicated), the mortise cannot be reduced/maintained (persistent MCS widening/talar shift) or there is medial interposition preventing reduction, or in open medial injuries. Practical indicators: persistent talar shift on mortise despite correct fibular length/rotation, inability to restore MCS with syndesmosis reduction, or a medial “block” on reduction suggesting interposed deltoid/capsule.",
      "explanation": "Most bimalleolar-equivalent injuries stabilise once the lateral and posterior structures are anatomically restored; medial repair adds dissection and wound risk without clear routine benefit. The key reasoning is to treat the cause of talar shift: fibular malreduction, unaddressed posterior malleolus, or syndesmotic malreduction are more common than a deltoid that “needs repair.” Viva traps include repairing the deltoid to compensate for a short/external-rotated fibula, or ignoring a true mechanical block to reduction where exploration is appropriate.",

      "explanation": "The key management implication is whether the articular block is connected to the shaft (B) or not (C). 43C fractures usually result from high-energy axial load with severe soft-tissue insult; attempting early ORIF increases wound breakdown and infection.

      "answer": "Early fibular fixation can be helpful if it restores length/rotation and aids tibial reduction (especially simple fibula patterns) and improves ligamentotaxis. Avoid early fibular ORIF if soft tissues are poor laterally, fibula is highly comminuted/shortened (risk mallength), or if definitive plan is circular frame where fibular fixation may hinder tibial alignment or increase wound risk.",
      "explanation": "Fixing the fibula can act as a template for tibial length and mortise width, but a malreduced fibula locks in deformity and complicates plafond reconstruction.

Common construct: posterolateral buttress plate (or antiglide plate) with lag screws as needed; can be combined with anterior plating for other columns.",

Definitive fixation is delayed until infection risk and soft tissues allow; circular frame is often favoured in severe soft-tissue compromise.",

      "explanation": "AO/OTA is the most useful exam classification because it links to management complexity and outcomes. Partial articular (B) implies a remaining metaphyseal/diaphyseal connection that can guide reduction; complete articular (C) requires restoring the articular block then re-attaching it to the shaft. A common viva trap is calling all distal tibia fractures “pilon”; true pilon implies plafond involvement (B/C).",

      "answer": "Indications: high-energy AO/OTA 43C injuries, marked soft-tissue compromise (tense swelling, fracture blisters, open wounds), gross instability/shortening, polytrauma needing damage control, and when safe definitive ORIF cannot be performed within a short window. Temporary spanning ex-fix restores length/alignment and allows soft-tissue recovery before definitive fixation.",
      "explanation": "Soft-tissue condition drives timing more than the fracture pattern. Attempting early ORIF through compromised skin increases wound breakdown and deep infection. The staged approach also facilitates CT planning after provisional reduction. Pitfall: leaving the ankle in equinus in the frame, leading to contracture and difficult later reduction.",

      "answer": "Essential: AP, lateral and mortise ankle radiographs plus full-length tibia/fibula views; CT (thin-slice with 3D recon) for articular mapping. CT is ideally performed after provisional reduction with spanning external fixation (or after a good splint reduction) to avoid misleading fragment positions.",
      "explanation": "CT defines the major plafond fragments (often anterolateral/Chaput, posterolateral/Volkmann, medial malleolar) and guides approach selection and fixation sequence.

Goals: restore length, alignment and rotation; maintain a plantigrade foot; allow soft-tissue recovery and CT planning. Keep pins out of the zone of injury and planned plate corridors; avoid equinus by adjusting the foot position.",
      "explanation": "Pin placement must anticipate definitive approaches (anterolateral/anteromedial) to avoid contamination and iatrogenic infection at the future surgical field. Calcaneal pin trajectory should avoid the subtalar joint and neurovascular structures; medial start helps avoid the sural nerve laterally.

      "explanation": "The complication rate is driven by soft-tissue readiness rather than a fixed number of days.

If dual incisions are used, maintain an adequate skin bridge (commonly ≥7 cm) and avoid crossing compromised skin/blisters.",
      "explanation": "CT-based approach selection reduces soft-tissue stripping and improves ability to buttress shear fragments.

Reduce and buttress posterior fragment with a posterior plate/screws as indicated.",
      "explanation": "Direct posterior buttress is often required for posterior shear fragments; indirect anterior-to-posterior screws can miss the fragment or fail under shear.

Hazards: superficial peroneal nerve injury, wound problems if swelling persists, and conflict with prior lateral pin sites or fibula incision/plate.",
      "explanation": "Anterolateral plating is commonly preferred because medial skin is tenuous and medial plates have higher wound complication rates in some patterns.

Rationale: supports the reduced plafond, reduces secondary subsidence, and helps maintain length/alignment; options include autograft, allograft, or calcium phosphate-based substitutes.",
      "explanation": "Pilon fractures often have central impaction; elevating the joint surface creates a cavity that can collapse if not supported.

Concept: percutaneous/mini-open reduction of the plafond with screws/K-wires to create an articular block, then a circular frame to stabilise metaphysis/diaphysis (often with a spanning foot ring initially) maintaining alignment and allowing biology-friendly healing.",

Salvage for painful arthritis: ankle arthrodesis (often preferred in severe deformity/poor bone stock), total ankle replacement in highly selected cases with good alignment/soft tissues, or tibiotalocalcaneal fusion if subtalar involvement/poor talus.

Management priority is urgent fasciotomy when clinically indicated (do not delay for imaging), alongside fracture stabilisation (often spanning external fixation) and planned staged reconstruction.",

      "answer": "43-C = complete articular: the entire tibial plafond is separated from the diaphysis (articular block not attached to shaft). 43-B = partial articular: part of the plafond remains attached to the metaphysis/shaft. It matters because 43-C typically needs staged management with restoration of length/alignment first and definitive articular reconstruction (often via multiple approaches) or frame-based strategies; 43-B may allow more direct fixation with fewer fragments and less metaphyseal comminution.",
      "explanation": "The defining issue is whether any portion of the articular surface remains in continuity with the shaft. CT (axial/coronal/sagittal) clarifies the major fragments (anterolateral Chaput, posterolateral Volkmann, medial malleolar fragment) and metaphyseal comminution, which dictates approach and fixation.

      "question": "Describe safe pin placement for a spanning ankle external fixator in pilon fractures, including key neurovascular/soft-tissue avoidance points.",
      "answer": "Tibial pins: anteromedial tibial crest/subcutaneous border, well proximal to the fracture zone and planned incisions/plates. Foot pin: calcaneal transfixion pin from medial to lateral (avoid posterior tibial neurovascular bundle medially and sural nerve laterally) or a medial cuneiform/first metatarsal pin if needed. Keep pins out of future surgical windows and avoid placing pins through blistered/compromised skin.",
      "explanation": "Pin placement must anticipate definitive approaches (anterolateral/anteromedial/posterior) and avoid contaminating future surgical planes. Too distal tibial pins risk being in the zone of injury and increasing infection/nonunion. Calcaneal pin trajectory and soft-tissue handling are common pitfalls—malposition can injure the posterior tibial artery/nerve or sural nerve and complicate later hindfoot procedures.",

      "question": "How do you achieve and confirm reduction when applying a spanning external fixator for a pilon fracture?",
      "answer": "Use longitudinal traction through the foot (calcaneal pin) to restore length and correct talar subluxation; adjust varus/valgus and rotation to align the tibial shaft with the talus. Confirm on image intensifier: AP/mortise for talar centring and tibial alignment; lateral for sagittal alignment and posterior malleolar position; check that the fibula length is restored if addressed. Ensure the frame holds reduction without over-distraction.",
      "explanation": "Over-distraction is a classic trap: it can compromise soft tissues, increase pain, and make later reduction harder. The key is talar centring under the tibial plafond and restoration of the mechanical axis, not perfect articular reduction at this stage. Document neurovascular status pre/post and reassess compartments—pilon fractures can coexist with compartment syndrome.",

      "question": "In an open pilon fracture, what is your staged strategy and what are the key decisions that influence definitive fixation choice?",
      "answer": "Urgent: antibiotics, tetanus, early debridement/irrigation, provisional spanning external fixation (and fibula stabilisation if it aids length/alignment), plus temporary wound management (VAC/temporary closure). Definitive: delayed fixation once soft tissues permit—options include ORIF (if soft tissues allow and contamination controlled) or circular frame/limited internal fixation. Decisions: Gustilo grade/contamination, soft-tissue envelope, bone loss/metaphyseal comminution, patient factors (smoking/diabetes), and availability of plastic cover.",
      "explanation": "Open pilon fractures are primarily soft-tissue problems with an articular fracture attached. Early aggressive internal fixation through compromised tissues increases deep infection risk. A common viva pitfall is committing to ORIF regardless of soft tissue status; circular fixation can be a safer definitive option when the envelope is poor or there is bone loss.",

      "answer": "Proceed when swelling has subsided with return of skin wrinkling, blisters have epithelialised/resolved, and there is no erythema/skin compromise; wounds are clean/dry if open. Typical timing is ~10–14 days post-injury (variable), guided by soft tissues rather than a fixed day count.",
      "explanation": "The soft-tissue envelope dictates safety; operating too early increases wound breakdown and deep infection.

      "answer": "Fix fibula early (often at time of spanning ex-fix) if it helps restore length, lateral column stability, and aids tibial reduction/CT planning—especially with simple fibular patterns. Avoid or delay if severe soft-tissue compromise laterally, highly comminuted fibula where length restoration is unreliable, concern about infection (open/contaminated), or when circular frame strategy will control length/alignment without fibular plating.",
      "explanation": "Fibular length can be a template for tibial alignment and helps reduce valgus/varus malalignment.

      "answer": "Choose the approach that gives direct access to the dominant displaced articular fragment(s): anterolateral for Chaput/anterior-lateral plafond and to buttress anterolateral comminution; anteromedial for medial plafond/medial malleolar extension; posterior (posterolateral or posteromedial) to reduce and buttress a large posterior (Volkmann) fragment and address posterior impaction. Combine approaches if necessary, respecting skin bridges (generally ≥7 cm) and prior pin sites.",
      "explanation": "CT mapping prevents “one-approach-fits-all” errors and reduces soft-tissue stripping by targeting the key fragment. Posterior fragments often control syndesmotic stability and plafond congruity; failing to buttress them can lead to posterior subluxation and early arthritis.

      "answer": "Fixing the posterior fragment first restores the posterior plafond buttress, helps re-establish tibial incisura/syndesmotic anatomy, and provides a stable reference for reducing remaining articular fragments. Common constructs: posterior buttress plate via posterolateral/posteromedial approach or lag screws from posterior-to-anterior (or anterior-to-posterior if anatomy allows) depending on fragment size and comminution.",
      "explanation": "A stable posterior column improves overall reduction and can reduce the need for syndesmotic fixation.

      "answer": "Use graft/substitute when there is metaphyseal void after elevating impacted articular fragments or significant metaphyseal comminution creating a cavity. The aim is to support the reduced joint surface and prevent secondary collapse, loss of reduction, and varus/valgus malalignment.",
      "explanation": "Pilon fractures commonly have central impaction; leaving a void risks late subsidence even with a plate.

      "answer": "Indications: severe soft-tissue compromise (blisters, open wounds, high infection risk), highly comminuted metaphysis, bone loss, polytrauma where minimal additional insult is desired, or when ORIF risk is unacceptable. Principles: stable multiplanar fixation with tensioned wires/half pins; restore length/alignment; achieve articular reduction with limited internal fixation if needed; allow early functional mobilisation and often earlier weight-bearing depending on stability and surgeon protocol.",
      "explanation": "Circular fixation can avoid large incisions and reduce deep infection risk in hostile soft tissues, but demands meticulous technique and follow-up. Limited internal fixation (e.g., percutaneous lag screws) can improve articular congruity while the frame manages the metaphysis.

      "answer": "Appropriate when specific articular fragments can be anatomically reduced and compressed with percutaneous lag screws or small plates through minimal incisions, improving joint congruity while the frame provides overall stability. Avoid placing internal implants through contaminated/open zones, avoid extensive periosteal stripping, and keep wires/pins from contacting plates/screws (no metal-on-metal contact).",
      "explanation": "The benefit is combining accurate articular reduction with soft-tissue-sparing stability.

Late: post-traumatic ankle arthritis (reduce by anatomic articular reduction and preventing collapse), nonunion (reduce by preserving biology, stable fixation, and addressing smoking/diabetes), stiffness/CRPS (reduce by early motion when safe and good analgesia/physio).",
      "explanation": "Pilon outcomes are driven by soft tissues and articular congruity; even small residual steps/malalignment increase arthritis risk.

PA screws: better compression and purchase into talar head/neck with longer trajectory, but require prone/lateral positioning and risk injury to posterior neurovascular structures if poorly placed.",
      "explanation": "PA screws can provide stronger fixation in comminuted neck fractures because the screw starts in the talar body and captures the head/neck.

      "answer": "Talar body fractures more directly injure the tibiotalar and subtalar articular surfaces, so post-traumatic arthritis is more common; AVN risk remains significant but outcomes are often driven by articular congruity. Operative priority is anatomic joint surface restoration and stable fixation, often requiring more extensile exposure (including malleolar osteotomy).",

Trap: treating a body fracture like a simple neck fracture with percutaneous screws—this risks leaving a step in the dome. CT is essential to define joint depression and fragment orientation. Even with perfect fixation, arthritis rates are high; counsel accordingly.",

      "answer": "Indicated when adequate exposure of the talar dome/body and medial shoulder cannot be achieved through standard anterior approaches, especially for posterior/medial body fragments or dome impaction. Use a chevron/step-cut osteotomy, predrill for fixation, protect posterior tibial tendon and neurovascular bundle, and fix with lag screws/plate ensuring anatomic reduction of the mortise.",
      "explanation": "The osteotomy improves visualisation for accurate articular reduction, which is the main determinant of outcome. Pitfalls: transverse osteotomy (nonunion/malunion), inadequate fixation, and iatrogenic malleolar malreduction causing ankle incongruity. Always plan the osteotomy line to preserve deltoid attachment and blood supply. Confirm syndesmotic stability and mortise congruence after fixation.",

      "answer": "Elevate depressed osteochondral fragments if viable, support with cancellous bone graft/substitute, and stabilise with headless compression screws or bioabsorbable pins if needed; if non-viable/small, consider debridement and microfracture as a salvage. Aim for a flush articular surface and stable fixation.",
      "explanation": "Leaving a depressed dome fragment leads to early ankle arthritis even if the fracture heals.

      "answer": "Typically immobilise in a boot/cast with early gentle ROM once wounds allow, but keep non-weight-bearing for ~10–12 weeks (or until radiographic union), then progress to protected weight-bearing. Be more cautious with comminution, tenuous fixation, associated osteochondral repair, smoking, or soft-tissue compromise.",

      "explanation": "MRI detects perfusion-related marrow changes before radiographs show sclerosis or collapse.

      "answer": "Protected or non-weight-bearing with close follow-up, optimise modifiable risk factors (smoking cessation, vitamin D), consider a patellar tendon-bearing brace/AFO, and monitor with serial radiographs/CT. Surgery is not routine unless there is progressive pain, impending collapse, or focal subchondral fracture amenable to joint-preserving procedures.",
      "explanation": "Many talar AVN cases can revascularise (creeping substitution) if mechanical load is reduced during the vulnerable phase.

      "explanation": "Joint-preserving procedures aim to improve revascularisation and mechanical support before irreversible deformity and arthritis develop.

      "explanation": "High-energy talus injuries are rarely isolated; missing associated pathology is a classic viva trap.

      "explanation": "The sign reflects subchondral osteopenia from hyperaemia/revascularisation.

Next step: urgent open reduction (dual approach as needed), remove interposed tissue/fragments, provisional K-wires, then definitive fixation or temporising spanning external fixator if soft tissues are compromised.",

Dual incisions improve control of rotation/varus and allow management of lateral comminution and subtalar joint assessment.",
      "explanation": "Single-incision approaches risk malreduction (especially varus) and can require excessive retraction/stripping.

A medial buttress plate helps prevent varus collapse and maintains neck length; lateral plate can address lateral comminution and rotational control.",
      "explanation": "Varus malunion is a classic complication due to medial comminution; a buttress plate counters this.

Use provisional K-wires, confirm reduction on multiple fluoroscopic views (including Canale view), countersink to reduce cartilage damage, and avoid overcompression if comminuted.",
      "explanation": "Posterior-to-anterior screws can provide better purchase and avoid anterior hardware prominence but require safe posterior access and careful protection of neurovascular structures.

AVN risk remains significant but functional outcome is often dominated by cartilage injury and residual incongruity.",

      "answer": "Immobilise and keep non-weight-bearing typically 10–12 weeks (individualise to fixation stability and radiographic progress), then gradual protected weight-bearing in a boot. Serial WB radiographs to assess union, alignment, and Hawkins sign; CT if union is uncertain or symptoms persist.",
      "explanation": "Early weight-bearing risks collapse if AVN or incomplete union develops, but prolonged immobilisation increases stiffness—balance based on stability and imaging. A trap is relying on non-WB films; WB views better demonstrate subtle collapse/arthritis once permitted. Counsel about prolonged recovery and high arthritis risk even with union.",

      "answer": "Start with serial radiographs (look for Hawkins sign, sclerosis, collapse) and clinical correlation; CT assesses subchondral collapse and joint congruity. MRI can detect early AVN but is limited by metal artefact and postoperative marrow oedema; it is most useful when artefact is minimal and before collapse to guide offloading and prognosis.",
      "explanation": "Management decisions hinge on whether there is structural collapse rather than MRI signal alone.

Consider joint-preserving options in selected cases (core decompression ± bone grafting) before collapse; avoid high-impact activity.",
      "explanation": "Without collapse, the aim is to prevent progression and maintain joint congruity; many cases can be observed.

Choice depends on joints involved, bone stock, infection risk, deformity, soft tissues, and patient demands.",

Ensure good soft-tissue handling and consider staged approach if swelling/previous wounds.",
      "explanation": "Nonunion and malalignment are common failure modes; varus alignment increases lateral overload and nonunion risk.

      "answer": "Late complications: AVN, post-traumatic arthritis (subtalar/ankle/TN), malunion (especially varus), nonunion, stiffness, and hardware irritation. Surgical technique most influences malreduction/malunion, joint penetration, and soft-tissue complications; AVN risk is more related to initial injury severity/dislocation but can be worsened by excessive stripping.",
      "explanation": "Even anatomically reduced fractures have high arthritis rates due to initial chondral injury—set expectations.

      "answer": "If joint surfaces are preserved: corrective osteotomy of the talar neck (often medial opening/realignment) ± bone graft and revision fixation to restore alignment/length. If subtalar arthritis is established: subtalar fusion (with correction) ± additional procedures (e.g., calcaneal osteotomy) or TTC fusion if ankle also arthritic/AVN collapse.",
      "explanation": "Decision hinges on whether pain is from malalignment with salvageable cartilage or from arthrosis.

      "question": "In a displaced talar neck fracture (Hawkins II/III), what is your operative strategy: timing, surgical approaches, fixation construct, and key steps to reduce AVN/soft-tissue complications?",
      "answer": "Urgent reduction of any dislocation (ED or theatre) to protect skin and restore perfusion; definitive ORIF once soft tissues allow, but do not delay reduction. Use dual anteromedial + anterolateral approaches to visualise neck and both joints, preserving deltoid branches medially; consider medial malleolar osteotomy only if needed for body exposure. Achieve anatomic reduction (length/rotation/varus) with provisional K-wires; fix with two large cannulated screws (typically 4.0–6.5 mm) from anterior-to-posterior or posterior-to-anterior depending on fracture line and comminution; add a lateral mini-fragment plate as a buttress/anti-varus construct if comminuted or to prevent varus malunion. Avoid excessive stripping; confirm subtalar and tibiotalar congruity on fluoroscopy/CT; post-op strict NWB and monitor for Hawkins sign/AVN.",
      "explanation": "The biggest determinants of outcome are early reduction of dislocation (skin/vascular compromise) and anatomic reduction—varus malreduction is a classic viva trap leading to subtalar arthritis and poor function. Dual incisions improve visualisation and reduce malreduction risk, but aggressive medial dissection can jeopardise remaining blood supply; preserve the deltoid attachment when possible. Screw direction is chosen to optimise compression across the primary fracture plane and avoid joint penetration; comminution often needs a lateral plate to resist varus and maintain length. CT is useful pre-op (define comminution, body involvement, osteochondral fragments) and post-reduction if alignment is uncertain; missed subtalar incongruity and intra-articular screw placement are common pitfalls.",

      "question": "After ORIF of a Hawkins III talar neck fracture, the patient has persistent pain at 10–12 weeks and radiographs show no Hawkins sign. How do you interpret this, what imaging do you request, and what are your management options for (a) AVN without collapse and (b) AVN with collapse/arthritis?",
      "answer": "Absent Hawkins sign suggests increased AVN risk but is not diagnostic; presence of Hawkins sign is reassuring for preserved vascularity. Request MRI (metal-artifact reduction sequences) to assess talar viability and extent of necrosis; CT to quantify collapse, joint congruity and arthritis. (a) AVN without collapse: continue/prolong protected NWB, consider patellar tendon-bearing/Charcot restraint orthotic walker, optimise risk factors (smoking), and monitor serial imaging; joint-preserving options in selected cases include core decompression +/- bone grafting (limited evidence) and addressing any malunion. (b) AVN with collapse and/or symptomatic arthritis: salvage depends on joints involved—tibiotalar/subtalar arthritis or deformity often requires hindfoot arthrodesis (tibiotalocalcaneal fusion with nail/plate), isolated tibiotalar disease may be ankle fusion; severe talar body loss may need tibiocalcaneal fusion with structural graft/spacer, or talectomy as a last resort; consider staged procedures if infection/soft tissue issues.",
      "explanation": "A common trap is over-calling AVN purely from an absent Hawkins sign—its absence is sensitive for risk, but not specific; MRI clarifies viability while CT is best for structural collapse and arthritic change. Early-stage AVN is managed by protecting the talus from load to delay collapse; premature weight-bearing can precipitate dome collapse. Once collapse occurs, joint-preserving procedures rarely succeed and the goal shifts to a plantigrade, pain-free foot via fusion; choice of fusion is dictated by which joints are arthritic and the amount of talar bone stock. Another pitfall is ignoring malreduction/varus malunion as a driver of pain and arthritis—corrective osteotomy or revision fixation may be needed before committing to salvage fusion.",

Types: I non-displaced; II two-part; III three-part; IV comminuted (≥4 fragments).",

A reduced/negative angle implies posterior facet depression and loss of calcaneal height, associated with worse function and higher risk of subtalar arthritis; it supports CT assessment and consideration of reduction if displaced intra-articular.",
      "explanation": "Böhler angle is a quick surrogate for height and joint depression but can be normal in some fracture patterns (e.g. isolated anterior process) and can be hard to measure if the film is rotated.

Increased or disrupted angle suggests posterior facet depression and intra-articular injury, but it is less reliable than Böhler and highly dependent on radiographic projection.",
      "explanation": "Gissane’s angle can support suspicion of intra-articular involvement, especially when Böhler is borderline, but it is not a standalone decision tool.

Also consider non-op when CT shows severe comminution where anatomic reconstruction is unlikely and soft tissues are high risk.",

The key complication to prevent is posterior skin necrosis from persistent tuberosity displacement; also prevent loss of reduction into varus/equinus.",

Rationale: avoid failed ORIF and later staged fusion, enabling earlier definitive pain control and alignment restoration.",
      "explanation": "Sanders IV has high rates of post-traumatic subtalar arthritis and secondary fusion after ORIF. The trap is fusing without restoring heel height/varus/width—fusion alone does not correct malalignment; the operation must be a reconstructive fusion with shape restoration.",

Address Achilles tightness if contributing (gastrocnemius recession) and ensure alignment to slight valgus.",
      "explanation": "Pain often comes from both arthritis and mechanical impingement; treating only one component leads to persistent symptoms.

      "answer": "Sanders is based on the number/location of fracture lines through the posterior facet on the coronal CT slice at the widest part of the posterior facet. Type I: nondisplaced (<2 mm) regardless of lines → usually non-op. Type II: two-part posterior facet (one fracture line) → ORIF often appropriate. Type III: three-part (two lines) with central depression → ORIF possible but higher risk of subtalar arthritis. Type IV: comminuted (≥3 lines/multiple fragments) → poor prognosis with ORIF; consider primary subtalar fusion in selected patients.",
      "explanation": "Sanders correlates with articular comminution and likelihood of restoring congruity. A common viva trap is quoting Sanders from plain radiographs—it's a CT-based system.

Pitfalls: poor lateral positioning, hindfoot varus/valgus altering measurements, and normal variants—angles support suspicion but do not replace CT for intra-articular assessment.",
      "explanation": "Angles are screening tools and help quantify loss of height and joint depression, but management decisions for displaced intra-articular fractures require CT.

Contraindications/relative: severe soft-tissue compromise (blisters, swelling), uncontrolled diabetes, heavy smoking, severe peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy/Charcot risk, non-ambulatory/low-demand, severe comminution (Sanders IV) where congruity unlikely, and inability to comply with non-weight-bearing.",

      "explanation": "Operating through swollen skin markedly increases wound necrosis and infection, especially with extensile approaches.

Manage urgently: splint in plantarflexion, elevate, and perform urgent reduction/fixation (often percutaneous screws/Schanz pin joystick) to relieve skin pressure; treat as an emergency to prevent skin necrosis.",
      "explanation": "The Achilles pulls the tuberosity fragment proximally, risking full-thickness skin loss—this is a classic viva emergency.

Typical sequence: restore length/height and varus/valgus by reducing tuberosity to sustentaculum, then elevate/reduce posterior facet fragments to the sustentaculum, then address lateral wall/width and calcaneocuboid joint if involved, finally fix with plate/screws and confirm hindfoot alignment.",
      "explanation": "Using the sustentaculum as a reference improves reproducibility and reduces malreduction.

Consider separate fixation for calcaneocuboid joint fragments if unstable.",
      "explanation": "Sustentacular purchase improves stability because the medial fragment is dense and relatively constant.

Avoid MIS when there is severe comminution (Sanders IV), major lateral wall blowout requiring direct decompression, complex calcaneocuboid involvement, or inability to obtain/maintain reduction closed.",

Mandatory views: lateral, axial (Harris), Broden views for posterior facet congruity, and AP foot to assess calcaneocuboid joint alignment.",

      "question": "What is the clinical significance of lateral wall blowout in calcaneal fractures, and how is it addressed surgically?",
      "answer": "Lateral wall blowout increases heel width and can cause peroneal tendon impingement/tenosynovitis and sural nerve symptoms, leading to lateral hindfoot pain and shoe wear problems. Surgically, restore width by reducing the lateral wall and supporting it with a plate; in delayed cases, lateral wall exostectomy and peroneal tendon decompression may be required.",
      "explanation": "Patients may have persistent lateral pain even if the posterior facet looks acceptable—heel widening is a key driver. A trap is focusing only on Böhler’s angle and ignoring axial heel width. Over-reduction or prominent hardware can also irritate peroneals.",

      "answer": "Suggestive findings: pain on uneven ground, reduced subtalar motion, sinus tarsi tenderness, WB hindfoot radiographs showing joint space loss/sclerosis, and CT confirming arthritis/malunion. Salvage: subtalar arthrodesis (often with correction of varus and restoration of height), ± distraction bone block arthrodesis if loss of height/anterior ankle impingement, and consider lateral wall exostectomy/peroneal decompression if symptomatic.",
      "explanation": "CT helps distinguish isolated subtalar arthritis from calcaneocuboid involvement or malunion morphology.

      "answer": "Counsel: prolonged recovery (often 12–18 months), stiffness, risk of wound complications (especially extensile ORIF), risk of subtalar arthritis and possible later fusion, and time off work/driving. Predictors of poorer outcome: Sanders IV/comminution, smoking, diabetes, severe soft-tissue injury, open fractures, malreduction (varus/width), and heavy manual labour. Emphasise shared decision-making and realistic functional goals.",
      "explanation": "Examiners expect you to integrate fracture pattern, host factors, and soft tissues rather than defaulting to ORIF.

      "answer": "Views: lateral, axial (Harris), AP foot/ankle; add WB hindfoot alignment view later if planning reconstruction. Böhler’s angle (normal ~20–40°): reduced/negative suggests posterior facet depression and loss of height. Gissane’s angle (normal ~120–145°): increased/irregular suggests posterior facet collapse/comminution.",
      "explanation": "Böhler’s is a quick proxy for height and posterior facet depression; a “normal” Böhler’s does not exclude an intra-articular fracture, especially with tongue-type patterns.

      "question": "How is the Sanders classification assigned on CT, and what is the key pitfall in using it for decision-making?",
      "answer": "Sanders is based on the number/location of fracture lines through the posterior facet on the coronal CT slice at the widest talar body: Type I (≤2 mm displacement), Type II (2-part), Type III (3-part), Type IV (highly comminuted). Pitfall: it classifies posterior facet only and correlates imperfectly with function; soft-tissue status, tuberosity malalignment, and patient factors often drive treatment more than Sanders alone.",
      "explanation": "The “widest talar body” slice standardises the classification; mis-slicing leads to misclassification. Sanders I can still have major varus/shortening requiring reduction, while Sanders II–III may be treated non-operatively in low-demand or high-risk patients.

Non-op: minimal displacement (Sanders I), poor soft tissues, heavy smoker/vasculopath/poorly controlled diabetes, low-demand/elderly, severe comminution where anatomic reduction unlikely, or patient unable to comply with NWB/rehab.",
      "explanation": "The exam trap is treating “Sanders II = ORIF” as a rule; patient and soft-tissue factors often trump fracture pattern.

      "explanation": "Wound complications are the major morbidity of extensile approaches; timing is a modifiable risk factor.

At risk: sural nerve, peroneal tendons, lateral calcaneal artery (flap perfusion), and subtalar joint cartilage during reduction.",
      "explanation": "The lateral calcaneal artery is critical for flap viability; devascularisation leads to edge necrosis and deep infection.

Fix with a lateral plate plus lag screws into sustentaculum and tuberosity as needed.",
      "explanation": "Restoring shape before articular perfection prevents a well-reduced facet sitting on a malaligned heel.

Avoid injury to the tibialis posterior/FHL tendons and neurovascular bundle and avoid subtalar joint screw penetration.",
      "explanation": "Sustentacular purchase improves stability but is unforgiving: a few millimetres can enter the subtalar joint or exit medially.

Goals: restore height/length/varus and stabilise the facet with less soft-tissue insult; accept that perfect articular reduction may be harder than with extensile ORIF.",

Limitations: reduced ability to correct severe tuberosity malalignment/width and to address extensive comminution; fixation options may be more limited (screws/small plates).",
      "explanation": "The sinus tarsi approach is a common FRCS discussion point as a compromise between reduction quality and soft-tissue safety.

      "answer": "An avulsion fragment from the Lisfranc ligament (typically from the base of the 2nd metatarsal or medial cuneiform), indicating ligamentous disruption and likely instability requiring operative stabilisation.",
      "explanation": "The fleck sign is a surrogate for a torn Lisfranc ligament even if gross diastasis is minimal. Pitfall: treating as a minor avulsion fracture with a boot; instability can progress and lead to collapse/arthritis. CT helps define associated fractures and joint congruity.",

      "explanation": "The 2nd metatarsal base sits recessed between cuneiforms and dictates midfoot alignment; restoring it helps reduce the rest. Pitfall: fixing the 1st TMT first can lock in malreduction and leave the keystone displaced, leading to persistent instability and arthritis.",

      "explanation": "Transarticular screws provide strong compression but violate cartilage and often require removal.

      "explanation": "Transarticular screws violate cartilage and can worsen post-traumatic arthritis; bridge plates can provide stable fixation without crossing the joint surface (though they still require later removal in many cases). Pitfall: under-sizing plates or inadequate screw purchase leading to loss of reduction; ensure plate spans stable bone and consider multiple points of fixation.",

      "answer": "Use direct visualisation and fluoroscopic stress (abduction/pronation stress, 'gap' assessment) across the medial-intermediate cuneiform and 1st–2nd TMT; fix intercuneiform instability with screw/plate if present. Missing it risks recurrent diastasis and arch collapse despite apparent TMT fixation.",
      "explanation": "Lisfranc injuries are often complex with intercuneiform disruption that drives persistent widening.

      "question": "In an acute purely ligamentous Lisfranc injury with clear instability, what factors favour primary TMT fusion over ORIF?",
      "answer": "Primary fusion is favoured when instability is purely ligamentous (high risk of post-traumatic arthritis), in high-demand patients where avoiding secondary surgery is desirable, and when there is clear medial/middle column instability (1st–3rd TMT) without reconstructable articular injury.",
      "explanation": "Pure ligament injuries have high rates of late arthritis after ORIF, often requiring secondary fusion; primary fusion can provide more predictable pain relief and stability.

      "explanation": "Medial/middle columns are key for stability and tolerate fusion well; the lateral column contributes to accommodation on uneven ground and fusion can cause stiffness and pain.

      "answer": "Key rules: (1) AP: medial border of 2nd metatarsal aligns with medial border of intermediate cuneiform; (2) oblique: medial border of 4th metatarsal aligns with medial border of cuboid; (3) lateral: no dorsal step-off of metatarsal bases relative to cuneiforms. Abnormal: diastasis >2 mm between bases of 1st–2nd metatarsals or between medial cuneiform and 2nd metatarsal; “fleck sign” (avulsion fragment from medial cuneiform/2nd met base) indicates Lisfranc ligament disruption.",
      "explanation": "Lisfranc injuries are commonly missed on non-WB films; instability is best unmasked on WB views because the midfoot is a load-sharing joint complex. The alignment rules are quick viva-friendly checks; any loss of colinearity or dorsal step-off suggests tarsometatarsal (TMT) subluxation.

      "answer": "Obtain bilateral WB AP/oblique/lateral foot radiographs (or stress views if unable to WB), then CT of the midfoot for fracture mapping and subtle subluxation; consider MRI if persistent high suspicion with equivocal WB/CT (to assess Lisfranc ligament complex and occult injury). CT adds: identification of small avulsion fractures, comminution, intercuneiform involvement, and precise joint incongruity to guide ORIF vs primary fusion planning.",
      "explanation": "WB radiographs are the key discriminator for instability; comparing to the contralateral side helps in subtle diastasis. CT is essential for operative planning because it defines the fracture pattern and articular comminution, which strongly influences whether stable fixation is feasible or whether primary fusion is more appropriate. MRI is not routine for clear unstable injuries but is useful for purely ligamentous injuries when radiographs/CT are inconclusive.

Non-operative is acceptable for stable, non-displaced injuries with no diastasis on WB views and for isolated dorsal capsular sprains without instability (managed in boot/cast with repeat WB imaging).",
      "explanation": "The key determinant is instability, not pain severity. Unstable Lisfranc injuries treated non-operatively have high rates of chronic pain, deformity and post-traumatic arthritis.

      "answer": "Primary fusion favoured in: purely ligamentous Lisfranc instability, significant articular comminution of the 1st–3rd TMT joints, delayed presentation with established incongruity, high-risk of post-traumatic arthritis, or failed ORIF. Typically fuse the medial column: 1st TMT, 2nd TMT and often 3rd TMT; preserve the 4th–5th TMT joints (mobile lateral column) unless grossly unstable or severely comminuted.",
      "explanation": "The medial and middle columns are inherently stiffer and tolerate fusion well; the lateral column contributes to accommodation on uneven ground, so routine fusion there risks stiffness and transfer pain. Purely ligamentous injuries have higher rates of late arthritis after ORIF and often do better with primary fusion in terms of reoperation for hardware removal/secondary fusion.

      "answer": "Approach: dorsal incisions over 1st–2nd TMT interval and/or between 2nd–3rd rays; protect superficial peroneal nerve branches and dorsalis pedis artery/deep peroneal nerve. Reduction sequence: restore 2nd metatarsal base into the mortise between cuneiforms (keystone), then reduce/fix 1st TMT, then address intercuneiform instability and 3rd TMT as needed; assess lateral column stability last. Fixation: transarticular screws (e.g., medial cuneiform to 2nd metatarsal “Lisfranc screw”, plus screws/plates for 1st–3rd TMT) or dorsal bridge plating to avoid further cartilage injury; temporary K-wires can hold reduction.",
      "explanation": "The second ray is the keystone; if it is not anatomically reduced, the rest of the midfoot will remain malaligned and arthritis is likely. Dorsal bridge plates can be advantageous in comminution or when you want to minimise additional articular damage from transarticular screws, but they still require precise reduction.

      "answer": "Steps: anatomic reduction of the medial/middle columns; prepare joint surfaces (remove cartilage to bleeding bone, preserve length), correct intercuneiform instability, and maintain the arch. Fixation: compression across each fused joint using lag screws and/or plantar/medial plates (or dorsal plates) with stable constructs; consider intercuneiform screw/plate if unstable. Use bone graft if there is bone loss/comminution; confirm alignment on fluoroscopy (AP/oblique/lateral) and ensure no dorsal subluxation.",
      "explanation": "Fusion must restore column length and sagittal plane alignment; shortening or dorsiflexion malalignment leads to transfer metatarsalgia and arch collapse. Compression and stability are the determinants of union; comminution often necessitates plating rather than relying on lag screws alone. Pitfall: ignoring intercuneiform instability—failure to stabilise it can allow recurrent diastasis despite TMT fusion.

      "answer": "Most important predictor: quality of anatomic reduction (especially 2nd TMT and intercuneiform alignment). Early complications: wound problems, infection, compartment syndrome (rare), neurovascular injury, loss of reduction/hardware failure. Late complications: post-traumatic midfoot arthritis, chronic pain, stiffness, nonunion (after fusion), and need for secondary arthrodesis or hardware removal.",
      "explanation": "Even small residual incongruity in the midfoot leads to high contact pressures and arthritis; this is a classic FRCS viva point. Dorsal soft tissues are tenuous—swelling and blistering increase wound risk, so timing and incision planning matter. Loss of reduction is more common if instability is underestimated (e.g., missed intercuneiform/lateral column injury).

Decision is based on symptoms, WB radiographs/CT showing arthritis and malalignment, and which joints are involved; aim to restore plantigrade foot and arch.",
      "explanation": "By 6 months, many missed injuries have developed arthrosis and malalignment, making fusion the definitive pain-relieving option. CT helps define which joints are arthritic and guides a limited vs more extensive fusion; over-fusing can cause stiffness, under-fusing risks persistent pain. Pitfall: attempting late ORIF in the presence of established arthritis—this often fails and delays definitive fusion.

      "answer": "A spanning medial and/or lateral column external fixator (e.g., tibia-to-first metatarsal/medial cuneiform and/or calcaneus-to-4th/5th metatarsal) to restore length, maintain alignment, allow soft-tissue recovery, and facilitate later definitive ORIF/bridge plating.",
      "explanation": "External fixation provides ligamentotaxis and column length restoration while avoiding further soft-tissue insult. It also reduces pain and compartment pressure risk by stabilising the foot. Pitfalls include poor pin placement through planned incision zones, pins too distal causing metatarsal fracture, and failure to correct abduction/adduction leading to a “fixed” malalignment at definitive surgery.",

      "answer": "Place pins outside future surgical approaches and plate corridors, use safe corridors (tibial anteromedial, calcaneal tuberosity, metatarsal shafts), maximise pin spread and bicortical purchase, avoid transfixing joints unless intended, and keep pin sites away from compromised skin/blisters.",
      "explanation": "Pin-tract infection and interference with later incisions are common avoidable problems. Metatarsal pins should be in the diaphysis with care to avoid plantar structures and to prevent iatrogenic fracture.

      "answer": "Choose plating for long oblique/comminuted patterns, segmental fractures, failed closed reduction, or when precise length/rotation control is needed (especially multiple metatarsals). Use low-profile plates, bridge comminution rather than stripping it, maintain length/parabola, and avoid prominent dorsal hardware over extensor tendons.",
      "explanation": "IM K-wires are quick but can be less controlling for length/rotation in comminution. Bridge plating provides relative stability while preserving biology.

Zone 2 (Jones at metaphyseal–diaphyseal junction): higher nonunion risk—consider non-WB casting vs early screw fixation in athletes. Zone 3 (proximal diaphyseal stress): often needs prolonged immobilisation or operative fixation ± bone graft; pitfall is mislabelling a Jones as an avulsion and allowing early WB.",
      "explanation": "Blood supply watershed at the Jones region drives nonunion risk and dictates more cautious management.

      "explanation": "Undersized screws and malposition (too plantar/lateral) are common causes of failure.

      "explanation": "The hallux bears major load; incongruity leads to painful IP/MTP arthritis and loss of push-off.

      "explanation": "Internal fixation through contaminated tissue increases deep infection risk; temporary constructs maintain the metatarsal parabola and allow wound management.

      "explanation": "Foot compartment syndrome can be missed because pulses may remain present; diagnosis is clinical and time-critical.

      "answer": "Prefer dorsal bridge plating when there is comminution, poor screw purchase, high risk of articular damage from screws, or need to span multiple columns (e.g. 1st–2nd TMT) to maintain length/alignment. Aim is anatomic reduction of the medial column and restoration of the second metatarsal–intermediate cuneiform relationship, using the plate as a buttress/bridge without violating the joint surfaces with screws.",
      "explanation": "Bridge plates avoid iatrogenic cartilage injury from transarticular screws and can control comminuted patterns by spanning the joint. The viva trap is “stable on fluoroscopy” without weight-bearing alignment—WB radiographs (when safe) and CT-defined reduction targets matter. Pitfalls: malreduction of the second metatarsal base (keystone), failure to restore medial column length, and leaving intercuneiform instability unaddressed.

Apply a medial column or ankle-to-forefoot spanning frame restoring length and alignment; place pins outside planned incisions, avoid the dorsalis pedis region, and use bicortical purchase in safe corridors.",
      "explanation": "External fixation maintains reduction and protects soft tissues while swelling settles, reducing wound complications. Common pitfalls are pin placement through future surgical approaches, pin tract infection, and over-distraction causing compartment issues or neurovascular stretch. A practical viva point: use the frame to restore the arch/length (ligamentotaxis) but do not accept malreduction—CT after spanning can help plan definitive fixation.

      "answer": "Choose bridge plating when there is comminution, medial column shortening, poor fragment purchase, or inability to maintain talonavicular congruity with lag screws alone. The goal is to restore navicular length and medial column alignment while protecting the articular surfaces and maintaining reduction until union.",
      "explanation": "The navicular is a keystone of the medial column; shortening leads to forefoot abduction and planus. Bridge constructs act as an internal fixator and are particularly useful when the central fragment is crushed. Pitfalls: accepting subtle shortening, failing to address associated midfoot injuries (Lisfranc/cuneiform), and over-compressing the talonavicular joint.

Reduction targets: restore navicular length, talonavicular joint congruity, naviculocuneiform alignment, and medial column height without varus/valgus malalignment.",
      "explanation": "Plain films underestimate comminution and joint involvement; CT guides whether lag screws, mini-fragment plates, or bridging is feasible. A common trap is focusing only on the talonavicular joint and missing naviculocuneiform step-off or medial column shortening. Fluoroscopy should include AP/oblique/lateral of the foot and assessment of the medial arch profile.

Restore length by distraction (often with a spanning external fixator or laminar spreader), elevate depressed articular fragments, bone graft the void, and stabilise with a bridge plate across calcaneocuboid to 4th/5th metatarsal or cuboid plating as appropriate.",
      "explanation": "The key is length: persistent shortening causes forefoot abduction, lateral pain, and peroneal dysfunction. Viva pitfall: fixing fragments without addressing the impacted void—collapse recurs without graft/support.

Lag screws: long oblique/spiral patterns with good bone quality; achieve interfragmentary compression with neutralisation if needed. Plates (mini-fragment): comminuted/segmental fractures, multiple fractures, or when length/rotation control is critical; restore length and rotation, avoid excessive periosteal stripping, and keep hardware low-profile dorsally.",

      "question": "Why are first metatarsal fractures treated more aggressively than central metatarsals, and what fixation options are preferred?",
      "answer": "The first ray bears a disproportionate load and controls forefoot alignment; malunion causes hallux valgus/varus, transfer metatarsalgia, and gait dysfunction. Displaced/unstable fractures usually need ORIF with lag screws and/or a plate (often dorsomedial), restoring length, rotation, and sagittal alignment; consider bridge plating if comminuted.",
      "explanation": "Accepting deformity in the first metatarsal is a common viva trap—small malalignments are poorly tolerated. Beware plantarflexion malunion leading to sesamoid overload and metatarsalgia. Fixation should respect soft tissues and avoid prominent dorsal hardware under extensor hallucis longus. Always assess the TMT joint for associated injury.",

      "answer": "Urgent IV antibiotics, tetanus, early debridement/irrigation, and stabilisation. Use temporary K-wires or external fixation to maintain length/alignment with minimal additional soft-tissue insult; delay definitive plating until soft tissues permit. Aim for early soft-tissue coverage if needed and plan repeat debridement for heavily contaminated wounds.",
      "explanation": "Forefoot soft tissues are unforgiving; definitive plates through swollen skin increase infection and wound breakdown. The trap is “anatomic ORIF at first sitting” in a dirty wound—prioritise debridement and stable alignment. External fixation can maintain the metatarsal parabola and prevent shortening.

      "answer": "Operate for open fractures, irreducible dislocation, intra-articular step with joint incongruity, significant rotational deformity, unstable fractures that redisplace, and hallux fractures with displacement affecting the IP/MTP joint. Fixation options include K-wires, lag screws (selected patterns), or mini-fragment plates in the hallux.",
      "explanation": "Rotation is the key clinical driver—malrotation causes shoe-wear problems and painful callosities even if X-rays look acceptable.

      "question": "Why can a dorsal MTP dislocation be irreducible closed, and what is the preferred open reduction approach?",
      "answer": "Irreducibility is often due to interposition of the plantar plate, sesamoid complex (hallux), or collateral structures with buttonholing of the metatarsal head. Preferred approach is dorsal: protects plantar neurovascular bundle, allows release of interposed tissue, and facilitates K-wire stabilisation if unstable.",
      "explanation": "Repeated forceful closed attempts can worsen soft-tissue injury and swelling—an exam trap. Dorsal approach provides safe access and avoids plantar scar sensitivity. After reduction, assess stability through range; temporary transarticular K-wire may be needed. Consider associated metatarsal head/phalangeal fractures on imaging.",

      "answer": "Typically non-weight bearing until early union and soft-tissue recovery, then progressive protected weight bearing in a boot; consider planned removal once union is confirmed if the plate spans joints and limits motion or causes symptoms. Delay or avoid removal if there is concern about stability, poor bone quality, neuropathy, or evolving post-traumatic arthritis where arthrodesis may be needed.",
      "explanation": "Bridge plates are often intended as temporary internal fixators; leaving them can cause stiffness and hardware irritation, but premature removal risks collapse/diastasis. The trap is a fixed “remove at X weeks” rule—base it on radiographic union, CT if uncertain, and clinical stability. In neuropathic patients, prolonged protection and sometimes definitive arthrodesis is safer. Always counsel that pain may persist due to cartilage injury rather than hardware alone.",

      "answer": "Disproportionate pain, pain on passive toe movement, tense swelling, progressive neurological symptoms, and escalating analgesic requirement (pulses may be present). Decompress with prompt fasciotomies—commonly two dorsal incisions to access interossei/central compartments, plus medial (and/or plantar) release if indicated; leave wounds open with delayed closure/NPWT.",
      "explanation": "Foot compartment syndrome is commonly missed because swelling is expected and pulses can remain normal—classic viva trap. Pressure measurements can help but should not delay surgery in a convincing clinical picture.

      "answer": "Salvage options include targeted arthrodesis (talonavicular, naviculocuneiform, calcaneocuboid, or TMT), medial/lateral column fusion to restore length, and bone grafting (structural graft if column shortened). Principles: correct deformity, restore column length and plantigrade foot, achieve stable fixation, and address adjacent joint degeneration; consider staged correction if soft tissues compromised.",
      "explanation": "The aim shifts from joint preservation to alignment and pain relief. A trap is fusing the painful joint without correcting column shortening—persistent abduction/planus causes ongoing symptoms. CT helps define nonunion and adjacent arthritis to plan the fusion levels.

Examine for plantar ecchymosis, midfoot tenderness, and instability; assess alignment of the medial border of 2nd metatarsal with intermediate cuneiform and look for diastasis/step-off.",
      "explanation": "The 2nd metatarsal base is the Lisfranc keystone; a “simple metatarsal fracture” can be the tip of a midfoot instability. The common trap is treating it in isolation with a boot and missing diastasis that only shows on WB imaging.

      "answer": "Priorities: ATLS, urgent IV antibiotics, tetanus, photograph/wound cover with saline-soaked sterile dressing, reduce dislocation, splint, neurovascular check, analgesia, early senior ortho + plastics involvement. Debridement should be performed urgently (ideally within 24 hours) and sooner for gross contamination, vascular compromise, compartment syndrome, or devitalised limb; the rigid '6-hour rule' is not supported—quality of debridement with the right team is key.",
      "explanation": "Early antibiotics and reduction reduce infection and soft-tissue compromise more than racing to theatre with an unprepared team. The viva trap is quoting a fixed 6-hour threshold; examiners want you to stratify urgency by contamination, ischaemia, and physiology.

      "answer": "Give IV antibiotics as soon as possible (ideally within 1 hour of injury/presentation). Use local microbiology guidance; commonly IV co-amoxiclav (or cefuroxime) for lower-grade, add gentamicin for severe contamination/IIIB, and add metronidazole for farm/soil contamination; penicillin allergy: clindamycin ± gentamicin/metronidazole. Continue until first debridement; then tailor to findings and microbiology—avoid prolonged 'just in case' courses without indication.",
      "explanation": "The key FRCS point is timing: early antibiotics are strongly associated with reduced infection.

      "answer": "Excise clearly devitalised tissue (non-bleeding, non-contractile, non-viable fat/skin) and remove foreign material; preserve critical structures if viable (heel pad, tibialis posterior, Achilles, neurovascular bundles). Heel pad viability is judged by perfusion, attachment, and sensibility; preserve and reattach if viable, but avoid leaving dead space/necrosis. Repeat debridement is preferable to marginal tissue retention.",
      "explanation": "The pitfall is being over-conservative with questionable tissue, leading to infection and flap failure; conversely, over-aggressive excision of viable heel pad can create an unsalvageable weight-bearing defect. Tendons can look pale but still be viable—assess bleeding and integrity. Plan debridement with the reconstructive endpoint in mind.",

      "answer": "Suspicious findings: widened medial clear space, talar shift, tibiofibular clear space widening, loss of tibiofibular overlap, posterior malleolar involvement, and CT evidence of incisura disruption. Temporise with a spanning external fixator maintaining length/rotation and talar reduction; avoid relying on a splint alone if unstable or soft tissues are compromised.",
      "explanation": "Unstable mortise malreduction worsens soft-tissue swelling and risks skin necrosis, especially in open injuries.

Keep pins out of future incision/flap zones and away from the zone of injury; add percutaneous fibular fixation only if it aids length and is within clean tissue.",
      "explanation": "The fixator is a reduction tool and soft-tissue protector; poor pin placement can preclude later approaches or contaminate flap fields.

Stage (ex-fix + delayed ORIF) for Gustilo III, heavy contamination, significant swelling/blistering, compromised skin, vascular injury, or when flap coverage is anticipated.",

Delay increases infection, flap failure, and nonunion risk; repeated temporising dressings without a coverage plan is poor practice.",
      "explanation": "Examiners want you to link coverage timing to bacterial colonisation and the 'fix and flap' concept.

Avoid extensive peri-talar stripping; coordinate early soft-tissue coverage. Counsel high AVN risk; salvage options include delayed arthrodesis (tibiotalar/subtalar/tibiotalocalcaneal) if collapse/infection occurs.",
      "explanation": "The key is balancing reduction stability with preservation of tenuous blood supply.

Ensure the medial column length is restored, the second metatarsal base is reduced to the cuneiforms, and the soft tissues can be managed (VAC/temporary closure).",
      "explanation": "Midfoot malreduction rapidly compromises skin and leads to long-term disability.

      "question": "In an open foot/ankle injury with absent distal pulses after reduction, what is your immediate management pathway and how does it affect timing of fixation/coverage?",
      "answer": "Treat as limb-threatening: urgent senior review, repeat reduction/splint, Doppler/ABPI, and immediate CT angiography if pulses remain absent; involve vascular surgery and plastics early. Revascularisation takes priority; temporise the skeleton with an external fixator to protect repairs and facilitate access. Definitive fixation and flap coverage are coordinated after perfusion is restored and contamination controlled, often in a staged 'damage control' sequence.",
      "explanation": "The pitfall is attributing absent pulses to swelling and delaying imaging—time is tissue. Another trap is placing pins/incisions that compromise future bypass/anastomosis sites. Stable alignment reduces stretch on repaired vessels and improves flap success.",

      "question": "How do you assess and manage compartment syndrome risk in open foot injuries, and why can it still occur despite an open wound?",
      "answer": "Maintain high suspicion: disproportionate pain, pain on passive stretch, tense compartments, sensory changes; measure compartment pressures if uncertain. Perform prompt fasciotomies of involved compartments when indicated, even if there is an open wound, because the wound may not decompress all compartments. Leave fasciotomy wounds open with planned relook/closure/coverage.",
      "explanation": "Open wounds can be small or in a different compartment and do not reliably decompress the foot. The trap is reassurance from a skin breach and missing evolving compartment syndrome, leading to necrosis and clawing. Fasciotomy planning must consider later flap/skin graft needs.",

      "question": "For a severe open distal tibia/ankle injury, what definitive fixation strategies minimise soft-tissue insult, and what constructs are commonly used?",
      "answer": "Choose fixation that respects soft tissues: minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) where appropriate, limited open approaches, or circular external fixation (Ilizarov/Taylor Spatial Frame) for comminution, bone loss, or infection risk. Common constructs: ring fixator spanning ankle if needed, hybrid frames, or staged ORIF after soft-tissue recovery/coverage. Avoid large incisions through compromised skin and avoid placing plates under planned flap pedicles.",
      "explanation": "The fixation method is part of the reconstructive ladder; frames can allow early weight bearing and avoid implants in contaminated fields.

Consider primary amputation with non-reconstructible vascular injury, extensive plantar soft-tissue loss/insensate foot, uncontrollable contamination, prolonged ischaemia, or when functional outcome is predictably poor despite salvage.",

      "explanation": "Early antibiotics are the strongest modifiable factor reducing infection; delays for imaging or referral are common viva traps. Reduction restores perfusion and limits further soft-tissue damage; document NV status to avoid later attribution errors. Photographing and dressing avoids repeated wound inspection (contamination).

      "question": "What is the current FRCS-relevant principle for timing of debridement in open fractures, and which situations mandate immediate (night-time) theatre rather than next-day planned debridement?",
      "answer": "Debridement should be urgent and consultant-led, prioritised by contamination/physiology rather than a strict 6-hour rule. Immediate/emergency debridement is indicated for: vascular compromise/IIIC, gross contamination (farm/sewage), compartment syndrome, uncontrolled haemorrhage, devascularised limb/near-amputation, and irreducible dislocation or threatened skin/soft tissue.",
      "explanation": "The outdated “6-hour rule” is a classic trap; modern practice focuses on early antibiotics and timely, high-quality debridement with the right team. Some injuries cannot wait because ongoing ischaemia/contamination rapidly worsens infection and limb viability. For stable, less contaminated wounds, planned daytime debridement with plastics and appropriate equipment often improves outcomes.",

      "answer": "Extend wound as needed for access; systematic excision of all devitalised skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia and muscle using viability criteria (colour, consistency, contractility, capillary bleeding); remove foreign material; copious low-pressure irrigation; take deep tissue samples after debridement; preserve critical structures if viable (tendons, nerves, vessels); repeat debridement if doubt; leave wound open with appropriate temporary coverage.",
      "explanation": "Inadequate debridement is the commonest cause of deep infection and flap failure; “small wound = small problem” is false in foot/ankle. Muscle viability criteria are more reliable than appearance alone; borderline tissue should be re-assessed at planned second-look rather than left to declare itself under a flap.

Continue until definitive soft-tissue closure/coverage (typically 24–72 hours depending on grade and local protocol), not “for a week” by default.",
      "explanation": "The exam focus is early administration and appropriate spectrum; prolonged courses do not compensate for poor debridement and increase complications (C. difficile, resistance).

Place pins outside the zone of injury and outside planned flap/plate corridors (avoid anteromedial tibial and lateral malleolar incision lines); use safe corridors, predrill, and keep pin sites away from future microvascular anastomosis zones.",
      "explanation": "A spanning frame stabilises soft tissues and allows repeated access for debridement and flap planning; it also reduces pain and swelling.

      "answer": "Urgent reduction (often in ED) to restore perfusion; then urgent theatre for debridement and stabilisation. Definitive internal fixation at index surgery only if contamination is controlled, soft tissues allow, and stable fixation can be achieved without extensive additional dissection; otherwise temporise (K-wires/ex-fix) and return for definitive fixation once tissues declare and coverage is planned.",
      "explanation": "Talar perfusion is time- and displacement-sensitive; delayed reduction increases AVN risk. However, chasing definitive fixation through swollen, contaminated tissues increases infection and wound breakdown—another common trap.

Obtain CT after provisional reduction/ex-fix to define articular injury. Stage 2: definitive fixation once swelling subsides/skin wrinkling returns and soft-tissue coverage is available (often coordinated with flap), typically 7–14 days but driven by tissue condition rather than the calendar.",
      "explanation": "CT before reduction can mislead due to displacement; post-spanning CT improves planning.

Avoid primary closure with significant contamination, questionable tissue viability, tension, crush/avulsion, compartment concerns, or when a flap is likely (IIIB/IIIC); use temporary coverage and plan definitive closure/coverage early.",
      "explanation": "Tensioned closure converts an open injury into a closed compartment with compromised perfusion and higher infection risk. “Closing to protect the wound” is a trap—if debridement is uncertain, leaving it open for second-look is safer.

      "answer": "Heel/hindfoot: medial plantar (instep) flap for sensate heel; reverse sural flap for posterior/heel and lateral hindfoot. Malleolar/ankle: perforator-based propeller flaps where suitable; distally based fasciocutaneous options (including reverse sural for posterolateral). Dorsum: local rotational flaps for small defects; otherwise free flap. Free tissue transfer is needed for large defects, exposed bone/implant/tendon without paratenon, multiple-zone injury, or when local flap territory is compromised.",
      "explanation": "Region-specific flap choice is driven by durability (heel needs robust, ideally sensate skin), arc of rotation, and vascular reliability.

Plan incisions with plastics; keep plates away from flap pedicle/anastomosis zones; minimise hardware prominence; ensure alignment and syndesmosis stability before flap; avoid repeated returns through the flap by completing fixation and obtaining intra-op imaging prior to inset.",
      "explanation": "Stable fixation reduces shear and dead space, improving flap survival and infection control.

Use scoring systems (e.g., MESS) only as adjuncts; they do not reliably dictate amputation—shared decision-making with vascular/plastics and the patient is essential.",
      "explanation": "The plantar surface and heel pad are critical for function; a “saved” limb with non-plantigrade, insensate, ulcer-prone foot may be worse than a well-fitted prosthesis.

Other causes: inflammatory arthritis (RA/seronegative), haemochromatosis, neuropathic (Charcot), avascular necrosis of talus, infection, congenital deformity (clubfoot), and idiopathic (uncommon). Post-traumatic is the dominant cause, unlike hip/knee where primary idiopathic OA is common.",
      "explanation": "The ankle has relatively congruent cartilage and tolerates load well; loss of congruity after trauma drives focal overload and degeneration.

Combined pathology: hindfoot pain (sinus tarsi), pain on inversion/eversion, reduced/painful subtalar motion, and often fixed hindfoot malalignment. Examine alignment (varus/valgus), subtalar and midfoot motion, and gastrocnemius/Achilles tightness (Silfverskiöld).",
      "explanation": "TAR relies on a functional hindfoot to accommodate uneven ground; a stiff/painful subtalar joint predicts persistent pain after TAR.

      "explanation": "Non-weight-bearing films underestimate narrowing and malalignment.

SPECT-CT: when pain source is unclear (multiple joints) to localise symptomatic degeneration/stress. Findings may shift from isolated ankle procedure to combined hindfoot fusion, guide joint-preserving osteotomy, or contraindicate TAR if talar collapse/bone loss is significant.",
      "explanation": "CT is particularly useful when radiographs show deformity or suspected talar AVN/cysts that affect implant fixation.

Contraindications: end-stage global joint space loss, severe fixed talar tilt, significant talar AVN/collapse, neuropathy, active infection, and inability to correct foot/hindfoot deformity.",

      "question": "What are the key counselling points for ankle arthrodesis regarding function, gait, and long-term adjacent joint issues?",
      "answer": "High pain relief rates and durability; loss of tibiotalar motion leads to altered gait with increased demand on subtalar, midfoot, and knee. Patients often manage level walking well but struggle on uneven ground, slopes, and stairs. There is a risk of adjacent joint arthritis over time, and footwear modifications/rocker soles may help.",
      "explanation": "Fusion trades pain for stiffness; many patients underestimate the impact on uneven terrain. Adjacent joint degeneration is multifactorial (pre-existing disease, alignment, activity). A viva pitfall is promising “normal gait” or ignoring pre-existing subtalar arthritis which may require combined fusion.",

      "question": "What is the ideal position for ankle fusion and why does malposition cause problems?",
      "answer": "Neutral dorsiflexion/plantarflexion (0–5° dorsiflexion), slight valgus (about 0–5°), and slight external rotation matching the contralateral side, with the talus centred under the tibia. Equinus causes toe-walking and knee hyperextension; excessive dorsiflexion causes heel overload and crouch. Varus predisposes to lateral overload, peroneal symptoms, and adjacent joint arthritis; malrotation causes gait inefficiency and knee/hip pain.",
      "explanation": "Position is as important as union for function. Slight valgus aligns the hindfoot for load sharing; varus is poorly tolerated. The common trap is fusing in equinus due to unrecognised gastrocnemius/Achilles tightness—address with lengthening if needed.",

Transfibular: excellent exposure, allows fibular osteotomy and use of fibula as onlay graft, helpful in varus and when lateral gutter pathology; risks include nonunion at fibular osteotomy, peroneal tendon irritation, and altered lateral stability if not reconstructed.",

Anterior plate (often with compression screws): useful for poor bone quality, higher stability, revision, or when needing stronger resistance to shear/rotation. TTC nail: for combined ankle–subtalar pathology, poor soft tissues, severe deformity, neuropathic bone, or as salvage after failed fusion/TAR; accepts hindfoot fusion but sacrifices subtalar motion.",
      "explanation": "Construct choice balances stability, biology, and the joints you are willing to fuse. Screws alone can fail in osteopenia or deformity due to rotational forces.

      "answer": "Thorough cartilage removal to bleeding subchondral bone on both tibial plafond and talar dome, preserve as much bone stock as possible, correct deformity, achieve broad surface contact, and apply stable compression. Use multiple points of fixation to control rotation; consider bone graft if bone loss, cysts, or revision. Pitfalls: excessive bone resection causing shortening, leaving posterior cartilage, failing to correct varus/equinus, and inadequate compression leading to nonunion.",
      "explanation": "Union depends on biology (surface prep, graft) and mechanics (compression, stability).

      "answer": "Assess clinically (persistent pain, instability) and with WB radiographs; CT is often needed to confirm union and define gaps. Optimise risk factors (smoking, diabetes, vitamin D, infection screen). Management: if symptomatic nonunion—revision fusion with debridement, bone graft/biologics, and more robust fixation (plate + screws or TTC nail); consider external fixation in infection/poor soft tissue. Salvage for repeated failure or severe bone loss: TTC fusion, bulk allograft, or, rarely, amputation.",

Relative: young high-demand labourer, morbid obesity, heavy smoking, severe osteoporosis, significant bone loss/cysts, and severe adjacent joint disease that will still be painful after TAR.",
      "explanation": "TAR fails through loosening, subsidence, infection, and instability—each is amplified by poor bone, neuropathy, and soft tissue compromise.

      "answer": "Determine if deformity is intra-articular (talar tilt) vs extra-articular (tibia/hindfoot). Correct to a stable, plantigrade foot: may require deltoid release/reconstruction, lateral ligament reconstruction, calcaneal osteotomy (lateralising for cavovarus), first metatarsal dorsiflexion osteotomy, SMO, and gutter debridement. TAR should be implanted only once alignment and stability are achieved (staged if necessary).",
      "explanation": "Modern TAR can tolerate mild deformity, but persistent varus leads to edge loading, polyethylene wear, and loosening. Cavovarus is often driven by forefoot and hindfoot malalignment; correcting only the ankle is a classic failure mode.

Address gutters and osteophytes to prevent impingement and restricted motion.",
      "explanation": "Most early failures relate to malalignment and instability rather than “wear”. Over-resection weakens bone and predisposes to subsidence, especially in the talus.

      "answer": "Arthrodesis: usually protected non-weight-bearing initially (often 6–8 weeks) until early radiographic/clinical signs of union, then progressive WB; protocol depends on fixation rigidity, bone quality, and biology. TAR: often earlier controlled WB in a boot once wound healing is satisfactory (surgeon- and implant-specific), with emphasis on ROM and swelling control; avoid high-impact activities. Both require DVT prophylaxis and careful wound monitoring.",
      "explanation": "Fusion needs time for biological union; premature WB risks nonunion or hardware failure.

Salvage: revision TAR if bone stock and soft tissues allow and infection excluded; conversion to tibiotalar or TTC arthrodesis (often with structural graft) if bone loss/instability is significant; staged explant + spacer + later fusion/revision if infection.",
      "explanation": "Differentiating aseptic loosening from infection is critical and commonly tested.

      "answer": "Significant symptomatic subtalar/midfoot arthritis favours TAR to preserve ankle motion and reduce further overload—provided hindfoot remains functional and alignment is correctable. If subtalar arthritis is advanced and painful, consider TTC fusion (or combined ankle + subtalar fusion) rather than isolated ankle fusion or TAR. Midfoot arthritis may require targeted midfoot fusion regardless of ankle procedure.",
      "explanation": "Ankle fusion increases compensatory motion and stress in adjacent joints; if they are already arthritic, pain may persist or worsen.

      "answer": "Most ankle OA is post-traumatic (most common): malleolar fractures, pilon fractures, chronic syndesmotic injury, talar dome injury/AVN. Other causes: inflammatory arthritis, haemochromatosis, neuropathic (Charcot), infection, osteochondral lesions, malalignment (varus/valgus), and rare primary idiopathic OA. Ankle OA is more often post-traumatic with asymmetric joint wear and malalignment; primary idiopathic OA is uncommon compared with hip/knee.",
      "explanation": "The ankle has high congruency and cartilage resilience, so idiopathic degeneration is relatively rare; loss of congruity after trauma drives focal overload and early OA. Viva trap: failing to identify syndesmotic malreduction or talar tilt as the driver—treating “painful OA” without correcting alignment leads to poor outcomes.

Document: talar tilt, tibial plafond angle, anterior tibial osteophytes, joint space narrowing pattern (medial vs lateral), syndesmotic widening/malreduction, subtalar/midfoot arthritis, and overall coronal plane alignment (varus/valgus). CT (often WBCT) for joint surface, cysts, bone stock and deformity; MRI selectively for osteochondral lesions/AVN.",

End-stage is defined by bone-on-bone contact on WB views and fixed deformity/instability.",

      "answer": "Steps: remove all remaining cartilage, expose bleeding subchondral bone, create flat/contoured congruent surfaces, preserve as much bone stock as possible, correct deformity, and achieve broad cancellous contact. Microfracture/drilling can augment bleeding surfaces. Common error: excessive bone resection leading to shortening and poor contact, or leaving islands of cartilage that prevent fusion.",

Management: if malunion—corrective osteotomy/revision fusion; if aseptic nonunion—revision arthrodesis with debridement, bone graft (autograft/structural), and more robust fixation (plate or TTC nail). If infection—staged debridement, antibiotics, and delayed fusion; consider external fixation in compromised soft tissues.",

Reasonable options: TAR with staged or concomitant subtalar fusion in selected cases (to preserve some midfoot motion), or TTC fusion when both ankle and subtalar joints are end-stage. Isolated ankle arthrodesis in the presence of established subtalar arthritis risks persistent pain.",
      "explanation": "The goal is pain relief and a plantigrade foot, not simply preserving ankle motion.

Ensure adequate dorsiflexion/plantigrade foot by addressing equinus (e.g., gastrocnemius recession) rather than malpositioning components. Meticulous soft tissue handling to reduce wound complications.",
      "explanation": "Most early failures relate to malalignment, instability, and edge loading rather than “implant choice.” Viva trap: correcting equinus by placing the ankle in dorsiflexion with component malposition—this increases impingement and loosening.

Late: aseptic loosening, subsidence, polyethylene wear, osteolysis/cysts, impingement/heterotopic bone, adjacent joint arthritis, and periprosthetic fracture. Early detection priorities: wound problems/infection, component malposition/instability, and progressive subsidence/loosening on serial WB radiographs.",
      "explanation": "Wound issues can rapidly progress to deep infection and catastrophic failure—low threshold for intervention.

Decision factors: infection status, bone stock (especially talus), soft tissue envelope, deformity/instability, patient demand, and availability of revision components/experience. Infection generally favours staged explant and fusion.",
      "explanation": "Conversion to fusion is technically demanding because of bone defects and compromised biology; union rates are lower than primary fusion.

Joint preservation fits early–intermediate (especially asymmetric with correctable malalignment); fusion or TAR for end-stage symptomatic OA.",

Contraindications: end-stage global OA, uncorrectable talar tilt/instability, severe talar dome collapse/AVN, neuropathy/infection.",
      "explanation": "SMO aims to shift load to preserved cartilage and delay end-stage procedures.

Principle: create a stable, plantigrade, well-aligned foot before/at time of implant—correct hindfoot/forefoot deformity and instability (e.g., calcaneal osteotomy, ligament reconstruction, deltoid/lateral balancing, Achilles/gastrocnemius lengthening) to allow neutral implant positioning.",

Open anterior: good access for deformity correction and bone preparation; useful with prior lateral scars/hardware. Transfibular: excellent exposure, allows fibular onlay graft, useful in varus/valgus deformity and revision, but sacrifices fibula and can affect later TAR options.",

      "explanation": "Malposition is a common cause of poor function and adjacent joint overload; varus fusion is particularly poorly tolerated.

      "answer": "Options: (1) Revision TAR (component exchange/revision with bone graft/augments), (2) Conversion to tibiotalar or TTC arthrodesis (often with nail/plate and structural graft), (3) Debridement/liner exchange for selected wear/impingement, (4) Two-stage revision for infection, (5) Rarely amputation. Decision depends on infection status, bone stock (tibia/talus), soft tissues, deformity/instability, patient demand, and availability of revision systems/experience.",
      "explanation": "Revision TAR requires sufficient bone and correctable alignment; otherwise fusion is more reliable.

      "answer": "Significant adjacent joint arthritis favours TAR to preserve ankle motion and reduce compensatory overload through subtalar/midtarsal joints; ankle fusion can accelerate pain and degeneration in these joints. Pitfall: fusing the ankle in a patient whose main symptoms are from subtalar arthritis (or vice versa) without isolating pain generators.",
      "explanation": "The hindfoot compensates for lost ankle motion; if those joints are already arthritic, fusion can markedly worsen function and pain.

Look for subtalar joint space loss, subchondral sclerosis/cysts, posterior facet collapse, and hindfoot malalignment (varus/valgus) on Saltzman. CT defines extent (isolated subtalar vs talonavicular/calcaneocuboid involvement), bone loss, coalition, and screw trajectory planning.",
      "explanation": "WB radiographs show functional alignment and are essential before deciding isolated subtalar vs triple fusion. Saltzman view quantifies hindfoot varus/valgus and guides whether adjunct osteotomy is needed.

If unclear, sequentially inject ankle and talonavicular joints on separate occasions. Pitfalls: extra-articular spread, placebo effect, coexistent multi-joint arthritis, and interpreting steroid response (therapeutic) as diagnostic.",
      "explanation": "Clinical localisation is difficult because hindfoot pain overlaps across joints. Image guidance reduces false negatives from missed joint entry.

Triple arthrodesis: symptomatic arthritis/deformity involving subtalar + talonavicular and/or calcaneocuboid joints, rigid deformity, or high risk of adjacent joint progression. Contraindications/relative: active infection, severe vascular compromise, uncontrolled neuropathy/Charcot, poor soft tissues; heavy smoking and poorly controlled diabetes increase nonunion risk.",
      "explanation": "The decision hinges on adjacent joint status and deformity rigidity. Isolated subtalar fusion preserves midfoot motion and reduces nonunion risk compared with triple, but fails if talonavicular disease is missed.

Medial approach may be chosen for medial pathology, revision, or to avoid compromised lateral skin; risks include tibialis posterior tendon sheath, FHL, and neurovascular bundle (posterior tibial artery/nerve).",
      "explanation": "Most primary fusions are efficiently done through the sinus tarsi with good access to the posterior facet.

Position: neutral hindfoot (no varus/valgus), slight valgus (about 0–5°), and avoid excessive external rotation; confirm with intra-op hindfoot alignment and fluoroscopy (lateral, Harris/axial).",
      "explanation": "Fusion success depends on surface preparation and stable compression; leaving sclerotic bone or cartilage is a common cause of nonunion. Malposition is a major functional complication: varus malunion overloads lateral column and predisposes to ankle arthritis; valgus malunion causes impingement and peroneal symptoms.

      "answer": "Common: two large cannulated compression screws from calcaneus into talus (often divergent) or one posterior-to-anterior plus one lateral-to-medial. Add a third screw or a lateral plate/beam construct for poor bone quality, revision, bone loss, high BMI, or when deformity correction requires increased rotational control. Ensure screws do not violate ankle joint or subtalar joint margins.",
      "explanation": "Two-screw constructs provide compression and resist rotation if well positioned; the trap is parallel screws that allow rotation and loss of correction.

Options: local autograft (calcaneal, distal tibial), iliac crest autograft, allograft chips/structural graft, and bone graft substitutes as adjuncts.",
      "explanation": "Primary fusions with good apposition may not need graft, but post-traumatic cases often have sclerosis and voids.

Mitigation: smoking cessation, optimise glycaemic control, assess vascular status, meticulous joint prep to bleeding bone, robust fixation (consider additional screws/plate), bone graft in high-risk cases, and appropriate protected weight-bearing.",
      "explanation": "Nonunion is usually multifactorial—viva trap is focusing only on biology while ignoring stability (or vice versa).

Treat symptomatic nonunion with revision fusion: remove/replace hardware, debride to bleeding bone, correct alignment, add autograft (often iliac crest) ± structural graft, and use more stable fixation (multiple screws/plate or hindfoot nail if needed).",
      "explanation": "CT is the key investigation to avoid mislabelling a fibrous union as solid. Always consider occult infection in a painful nonunion—missing this is a major trap.

Clinical: limited subtalar motion, too-many-toes sign with fixed abduction, and midfoot pain. Imaging: talonavicular uncoverage/arthritis and lateral column degeneration.",
      "explanation": "The talonavicular joint is the key “lock” of hindfoot motion; if it is arthritic or unstable, isolated subtalar fusion often leaves pain and deformity.

Targets: plantigrade foot, hindfoot slight valgus (~0–5°), neutral forefoot (avoid residual supination/pronation), and appropriate talar head coverage without over-medialising.",
      "explanation": "Talonavicular reduction largely dictates overall foot position; if malreduced, the rest follows poorly. Overcorrecting into valgus or leaving forefoot supination are common reasons for lateral impingement or transfer metatarsalgia.

Preserve skin bridges, handle soft tissues gently, and avoid excessive lateral retraction to protect peroneals and sural nerve. Consider single lateral approach only in selected cases; avoid in severe medial pathology or when talonavicular access is inadequate.",
      "explanation": "Wound problems are a major morbidity in triple fusion; the trap is creating compromised skin flaps with poorly planned incisions.

Plates are useful for lateral column stability (CC joint) and in osteopenia; staples can be adjuncts but are less reliable for large deformity correction. Choose constructs that provide compression plus rotational control, tailored to bone quality and deformity magnitude.",
      "explanation": "Triple fusion fails when fixation does not control rotation and column length. The talonavicular joint has high nonunion risk—robust compression and surface prep are essential.

      "explanation": "TN nonunion is a classic FRCS topic because it drives failure of triple arthrodesis. Leaving a gap after correcting abduction is a common pitfall—compression must be maintained.

A lateralising (Dwyer-type closing wedge) calcaneal osteotomy corrects varus; combine with subtalar fusion if deformity is partly extra-articular or long-standing.",
      "explanation": "Subtalar fusion can correct some varus, but extra-articular hindfoot varus may persist and cause lateral column overload and ankle degeneration.

It is inappropriate in rigid severe valgus primarily driven by midfoot collapse requiring triple fusion correction, or when bone quality/soft tissues make osteotomy unsafe.",

Alternative in selected cases: double arthrodesis (subtalar + TN) if CC is preserved.",

      "answer": "WB AP/lat/oblique foot, WB ankle mortise, hindfoot alignment (Saltzman) view, and often CT for joint surfaces/subchondral cysts; assess hindfoot varus/valgus, talar tilt, TN coverage/abduction, Meary’s angle, calcaneal pitch, and joint preservation/arthritis pattern (subtalar vs TN/CC).",
      "explanation": "Alignment drives outcomes: a plantigrade foot with slight valgus is the goal. Saltzman view quantifies hindfoot alignment and helps decide if a calcaneal osteotomy is needed in addition to fusion. CT is particularly helpful post-trauma to define posterior facet bone loss and plan grafting/implant trajectory. Pitfall: planning from non-WB films underestimates deformity and midfoot collapse.",

      "question": "How do you choose between a sinus tarsi (lateral) approach and a posterolateral approach for subtalar fusion, and what structures are at risk?",
      "answer": "Sinus tarsi approach suits most primary fusions with minimal deformity and allows access to posterior facet; posterolateral approach is useful for significant varus/valgus correction, revision, or when needing broader posterior facet exposure. At risk: sural nerve and peroneal tendons laterally; FHL and posterior tibial neurovascular bundle if dissection strays medially/posteriorly.",
      "explanation": "The sinus tarsi approach is less invasive but can limit access in severe deformity or revision where joint preparation and correction are demanding. Posterolateral exposure improves visualisation for correction and grafting but increases soft-tissue risk.

      "answer": "Typically 2 large cannulated screws (6.5–7.3 mm) across the posterior facet, often from calcaneus into talus (or talus-to-calcaneus depending on anatomy), placed divergent to resist rotation; use thorough joint preparation, temporary K-wire positioning, and sequential compression with attention to hindfoot valgus (about 5°) and avoidance of varus.",
      "explanation": "Two-screw constructs improve rotational stability compared with a single screw. Compression is only effective if the joint surfaces are flat/bleeding and the hindfoot is held in the desired position during tightening. Pitfalls: screws violating the ankle/subtalar joint, malposition causing varus malunion, and failing to address bone loss with graft. Alternative constructs include a lateral plate or hindfoot nail in poor bone/revision.",

      "answer": "Remove all cartilage to bleeding subchondral bone across the posterior facet, perforate/square the surfaces (burr/osteotomes), correct sclerotic bone with multiple drill holes, and address bone defects with autograft/allograft; ensure full apposition under compression. In post-traumatic cases, the pitfall is leaving sclerotic, avascular bone and unrecognised facet incongruity/bone loss.",
      "explanation": "Nonunion is usually a biology + mechanics failure: sclerotic bone and poor contact defeat compression. Post-traumatic subtalar arthritis often has depressed facets and cysts—CT helps anticipate the need for graft and more extensive preparation. Another pitfall is inadequate exposure leading to “spot preparation” only. Consider smoking status and optimise modifiable risks.",

      "answer": "Aim for a plantigrade foot with hindfoot in slight valgus (approximately 0–5°), neutral dorsiflexion/plantarflexion at the hindfoot, and no forefoot varus/supination. Slight valgus reduces lateral overload and promotes a more normal gait and shoe wear.",
      "explanation": "Residual varus is a common cause of lateral column overload, peroneal tendinopathy, and recurrent pain; it is harder to salvage than mild valgus. Overcorrection into excessive valgus can cause medial overload and impingement, especially if the ankle has valgus tendency.

      "question": "In triple arthrodesis, what is a safe sequence for joint preparation/fixation to achieve reliable correction, and what deformity is easiest to miss intra-operatively?",
      "answer": "Common sequence: prepare and reduce TN first to control forefoot abduction/supination, then subtalar to set hindfoot valgus/rotation, then CC to balance lateral column length; fix TN and subtalar securely before final CC fixation. The commonly missed deformity is residual forefoot varus/supination (midfoot malalignment) despite a “good-looking” hindfoot.",
      "explanation": "TN reduction largely dictates overall foot alignment; if it is malreduced, the rest of the construct follows. Checking the forefoot-to-hindfoot relationship clinically (plantigrade, no supination) and with intra-op imaging prevents a painful malunion.

      "answer": "Subtalar: 2 large screws or screw + plate; TN: crossed screws or dorsal plate (often stronger in osteopenia); CC: screw(s) or plate depending on bone quality and lateral column demands. Add plates when bone quality is poor, correction is large, there is comminution/bone loss, or in revision; consider a hindfoot nail for salvage/revision with multi-level instability.",
      "explanation": "TN nonunion is a known weak point due to shear forces; a dorsal plate can improve stability compared with screws alone in selected patients.

      "answer": "Indicated when hindfoot malalignment is not fully correctable through subtalar reduction alone or when you need to shift the weightbearing axis to protect the fusion/adjacent joints. For hindfoot varus: lateralising (Dwyer-type or lateral translation) calcaneal osteotomy; for hindfoot valgus: medialising calcaneal osteotomy (less common in arthritic hindfoot unless combined deformity).",
      "explanation": "Fusion corrects joint position but may not adequately shift the calcaneal tuberosity under the tibia, especially in longstanding deformity.

      "answer": "Clinically assess the foot plantigrade on the table: if the hindfoot is neutral/slight valgus but the medial forefoot remains elevated (supinated), this is residual forefoot varus. A common adjunct is a first ray plantarflexion osteotomy (e.g., Cotton osteotomy) or midfoot osteotomy/arthrodesis depending on the level and rigidity.",
      "explanation": "If unaddressed, forefoot varus drives recurrence of hindfoot valgus/varus compensation and causes lateral overload or medial column symptoms.

Options: local autograft (osteophytes/calcaneal), iliac crest autograft, proximal tibial autograft, or allograft chips/structural graft depending on defect size; consider biologic adjuncts selectively.",
      "explanation": "Graft improves biology and fills defects to allow compression across a stable interface.

      "question": "How does pre-existing ankle valgus/varus influence your hindfoot fusion alignment and procedure choice?",
      "answer": "You must align the hindfoot to support the ankle: avoid creating hindfoot varus in an ankle with varus tilt (worsens medial overload) and avoid excessive hindfoot valgus in an ankle with valgus tendency (worsens lateral/medial impingement depending on pattern). Significant ankle arthritis or fixed talar tilt may require combined procedures (e.g., supramalleolar osteotomy, ankle fusion/arthroplasty planning) rather than isolated hindfoot fusion.",
      "explanation": "Hindfoot position changes the coronal plane moment at the ankle; malalignment accelerates ankle degeneration and can make future ankle reconstruction harder.

      "answer": "Work-up: clinical assessment (hindfoot tenderness, pain with inversion/eversion), WB radiographs, CT to assess fusion, and screen for infection if indicated (CRP/ESR, aspiration if concern). Management: address risk factors (smoking, vitamin D, diabetes), consider bone stimulator if delayed union and stable, and for symptomatic established nonunion perform revision fusion with thorough debridement to bleeding bone, bone grafting (often autograft), and more robust fixation (plate/screws or hindfoot nail) ± correction of malalignment.",
      "explanation": "CT is the key test because radiographs can overcall fusion. The common pitfall is revising without correcting the cause—malalignment, inadequate fixation, or poor biology. If infection is missed, revision will fail; low-grade infection should be actively excluded in painful nonunion.

      "answer": "Confirm deformity and fusion status with WB radiographs and CT; identify whether pain is from malalignment, adjacent joint overload, or nonunion. Management is usually corrective osteotomy through the fused mass (e.g., calcaneal osteotomy or revision arthrodesis with wedge resection) to restore a plantigrade foot; hardware revision and grafting may be required. Key principle: correct the deformity at the apex and restore the weightbearing axis under the tibia.",
      "explanation": "Varus malunion overloads the lateral border and peroneals and is a frequent cause of failure. Simply removing hardware rarely solves the problem if alignment is wrong. Pitfall: attempting small “tweaks” without defining the deformity plane (coronal vs sagittal vs rotational).

Avoid with careful incision placement, identifying/protecting sural nerve, keeping dissection in safe planes, using fluoroscopy for screw trajectory/length, countersinking hardware, and respecting soft-tissue envelope (especially in smokers/previous scars).",

Clinically assess subtalar motion and do a Coleman block test to distinguish forefoot-driven varus from hindfoot-driven varus. If talonavicular (TN) or calcaneocuboid (CC) joints are arthritic/stiff or deformity is multi-planar/rigid through midfoot, favour triple; if TN/CC preserved and deformity correctable at subtalar level, isolated subtalar fusion.",
      "explanation": "The common viva trap is planning from non-WB films and missing TN arthritis or a fixed midfoot component, leading to persistent pain after isolated subtalar fusion. Saltzman view quantifies hindfoot varus/valgus and guides whether correction can be achieved through subtalar fusion alone.

If adjacent joints are painful/arthritic or deformity spans multiple joints, consider triple arthrodesis.",
      "explanation": "Isolated subtalar fusion preserves more midfoot motion than triple and reduces adjacent joint overload, but only works if pain truly arises from the subtalar joint.

      "category": "Arthritis & Reconstruction > Subtalar fusion > Fixation constructs",
      "question": "What fixation construct and screw trajectory would you choose for isolated subtalar fusion, and when would you add a plate or nail?",
      "answer": "Standard: 2 large cannulated compression screws across the posterior facet (often from posterior calcaneus into talar body/neck, divergent for rotational control; or one posterior-to-anterior and one from calcaneal tuberosity to talar neck). Add a lateral plate or blade plate if bone quality is poor, there is significant deformity correction, comminution, or revision/nonunion. Consider TTC nail if there is combined ankle/subtalar pathology, severe deformity, neuropathy, or need for load-sharing in compromised bone/soft tissues.",
      "explanation": "Two-screw constructs improve rotational stability compared with a single screw; divergent trajectories resist shear across the facet. A common viva trap is placing screws too anterior into the talar neck risking joint penetration or inadequate purchase, or too plantar risking neurovascular injury. Plates/nails are not routine but are valuable when compression alone is unreliable (revision, osteopenia, large correction, Charcot-type scenarios).",

      "question": "When is bone graft or bone substitute indicated in subtalar fusion, and what are your preferred sources in UK practice?",
      "answer": "Indications: revision/nonunion, large cystic defects, post-traumatic bone loss/sclerosis after debridement, need to restore hindfoot height/length, poor host biology (smoker, inflammatory disease). Options: local autograft (calcaneal or distal tibial), iliac crest autograft for larger structural needs, and adjunct allograft/bone substitute as a void filler. Structural graft may be needed if restoring height to address valgus/impingement.",
      "explanation": "Most primary fusions can unite without graft if preparation and compression are good, but post-traumatic sclerosis and defects are high-risk for nonunion. Local graft reduces donor morbidity; iliac crest provides more volume and osteogenic potential when defects are substantial. Pitfall: using only substitute in a revision nonunion without improving stability and biology—mechanics and preparation are usually the limiting factors.",

      "question": "In adult acquired flatfoot with rigid deformity, what are the specific goals of a triple arthrodesis and what alignment targets do you aim for?",
      "answer": "Fuse subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints to correct hindfoot valgus, forefoot abduction and midfoot collapse; aim for plantigrade foot with neutral to slight valgus heel (avoid varus), restore medial arch and reduce forefoot abduction. Ensure talar head coverage on AP, Meary’s line improved on lateral, and hindfoot alignment near neutral on Saltzman. Avoid overcorrection into varus which predisposes to lateral overload and ankle arthritis.",
      "explanation": "Triple fusion is a deformity-correcting operation, not just a pain procedure; alignment drives outcome. The common trap is fusing in residual valgus/abduction (persistent deformity and shoe-wear issues) or overcorrecting into varus (lateral column overload, stress fractures, ankle degeneration). Radiographic targets provide objective checks intra- and post-operatively.",

      "question": "What sequence of joint preparation and fixation do you use in triple arthrodesis, and why does the talonavicular joint matter most?",
      "answer": "Prepare all three joints, but reduce and fix the talonavicular (TN) joint first (key joint) to control forefoot abduction and midfoot alignment; then correct and fix subtalar alignment; finally address calcaneocuboid (CC) length/position (often with wedge or compression depending on deformity). TN fusion position largely dictates hindfoot and midfoot posture; malposition here is difficult to compensate elsewhere.",
      "explanation": "The TN joint has the greatest influence on hindfoot motion and forefoot abduction; if it is malreduced, the rest of the construct follows it. A viva pitfall is fixing subtalar first and then struggling to reduce TN without undue tension, leading to nonunion or malalignment. CC is often the “balancing” joint—ignoring lateral column length can leave residual abduction or lateral overload.",

      "answer": "Indications: marked forefoot abduction with lateral column shortening (e.g., severe planovalgus) where TN reduction alone leaves persistent abduction or talar head uncoverage; intra-op assessment after TN reduction guides need. Technique: CC joint distraction with structural graft (often tricortical iliac crest or allograft) and stable fixation (plate/screws). Risks: nonunion, graft collapse, lateral foot pain, sural/peroneal irritation, and over-lengthening causing lateral overload and stiffness.",
      "explanation": "Not all triples require distraction; unnecessary lengthening is a classic trap leading to lateral column pain and difficulty with footwear. Conversely, under-correction leaves persistent abduction and medial column overload. Structural graft needs rigid fixation—simple screws may not control collapse in poor bone.",

      "question": "In subtalar arthritis with hindfoot varus, when do you add a calcaneal osteotomy to subtalar fusion, and which osteotomy is preferred?",
      "answer": "Add calcaneal osteotomy when varus is not fully correctable through subtalar reduction alone or when varus is driven by calcaneal malalignment (e.g., cavovarus) rather than just subtalar joint position. Preferred: lateralising (valgus-producing) calcaneal slide osteotomy to shift the heel laterally and reduce varus/lateral overload; consider Dwyer closing wedge for fixed heel varus with a laterally based wedge. Confirm with Coleman block to exclude forefoot-driven varus where first-ray plantarflexion correction may be needed instead.",
      "explanation": "Relying on subtalar fusion alone to correct a structural calcaneal varus can leave residual malalignment and lateral column pain. The key pitfall is misdiagnosing forefoot-driven varus; doing a calcaneal osteotomy in that setting may overcorrect and create valgus. Osteotomy choice depends on whether translation alone suffices or a wedge is required for bony shape correction.",

      "question": "A patient has rigid cavovarus, peroneal tendon symptoms, and subtalar arthritis. What combined bony procedures should you consider to achieve a plantigrade foot, beyond subtalar fusion?",
      "answer": "Consider subtalar fusion plus hindfoot varus correction (lateralising calcaneal slide or Dwyer), and address forefoot-driven varus with first metatarsal dorsiflexion osteotomy (or midfoot osteotomy if apex more proximal). If ankle varus contributes, consider supramalleolar osteotomy rather than forcing hindfoot valgus. Soft-tissue procedures (peroneal repair, plantar fascia release) are adjuncts but bony alignment is primary in rigid deformity.",
      "explanation": "Cavovarus is often multi-apical; fusing one joint without correcting the overall alignment risks persistent lateral overload, peroneal pathology and recurrence of symptoms. A common trap is trying to “dial in” correction at the subtalar fusion and ending in malposition or nonunion due to excessive force.

      "question": "How do you investigate and manage a suspected nonunion after subtalar/triple arthrodesis, and what are your revision principles?",
      "answer": "Investigate with clinical assessment (persistent pain, swelling, pain on stress), WB radiographs and CT to confirm union and identify which joint(s) are nonunited; screen for infection if atypical pain or raised markers. Optimise biology (stop smoking, vitamin D, glycaemic control) and assess alignment. Revision principles: thorough debridement to bleeding bone, correct malalignment, add autograft (often iliac crest) ± biologic adjunct, and increase stability (plate, multiple screws, or TTC nail if needed).",
      "explanation": "CT is often required because plain films can overcall union, especially at TN/CC. The trap is revising with “more metal” without correcting malalignment or removing sclerotic bone—mechanical and biological failure usually coexist. If infection is missed, repeated nonunion is likely; low-grade infection should be considered in painful nonunion with hardware loosening.",

      "question": "What intra-operative checks help you avoid fusing the hindfoot in varus/valgus or with residual forefoot abduction during subtalar or triple arthrodesis?",
      "answer": "Clinical: ensure a plantigrade foot with heel neutral to slight valgus when viewed from behind; check forefoot is not excessively abducted and that the medial arch is restored without supination. Fluoroscopy: hindfoot alignment view (or simulated Saltzman), AP foot for talar head coverage, lateral for Meary’s line and calcaneal pitch; confirm no joint penetration by screws. Temporarily pin and reassess before definitive fixation; compare to contralateral if available.",
      "explanation": "Malposition is a leading cause of poor outcomes despite radiographic union. The common pitfall is relying only on a lateral view and missing coronal plane varus, which drives lateral overload and ankle arthritis.

      "answer": "Correct valgus to near neutral/slight valgus (avoid residual valgus), restore hindfoot height if collapsed (consider structural graft/distraction if needed), and address lateral wall exostosis or calcaneal lateral wall blowout if present. Ensure peroneal tendons are decompressed and not tethered; consider lateral wall decompression/exostectomy when indicated. If TN/CC arthritis contributes, isolated subtalar fusion may be insufficient—consider triple.",
      "explanation": "Persistent lateral pain often reflects unaddressed impingement rather than nonunion.

      "explanation": "Cavovarus is often a forefoot-driven deformity with secondary hindfoot varus; flexibility dictates whether you correct the forefoot alone or add hindfoot osteotomy/arthrodesis. Weight-bearing radiographs show the true deformity and joint congruency; missing ankle instability or arthritis is a common viva trap because it changes from joint-preserving osteotomies to ligament reconstruction or fusion.

      "answer": "Technique: patient stands with heel and lateral border of foot on a block, allowing the 1st ray to hang free (unloaded). Positive (hindfoot corrects to neutral/valgus): hindfoot varus is flexible and forefoot-driven (plantarflexed 1st ray); treat forefoot (e.g. dorsiflexion 1st met osteotomy) ± soft tissue. Negative (hindfoot remains varus): hindfoot varus is fixed/primary; add hindfoot correction (e.g. lateralising calcaneal osteotomy or subtalar fusion if arthritic).",
      "explanation": "The test isolates the effect of a plantarflexed first ray; if unloading it corrects the heel, the heel varus is compensatory.

Plan: prioritise forefoot correction (dorsiflexion 1st met osteotomy) and reassess hindfoot; add calcaneal osteotomy only if residual varus persists after forefoot correction.",
      "explanation": "Radiographs complement the Coleman test by showing the bony driver and whether joints remain congruent.

      "question": "What are the indications for a midfoot osteotomy in cavovarus, and how do you localise the apex of deformity?",
      "answer": "Indications: rigid cavus with apex in the midfoot (e.g. plantarflexed midfoot/forefoot equinus) not correctable with first-ray osteotomy alone, often with dorsal midfoot prominence and persistent high arch. Localise apex using clinical contour and WB lateral radiograph (Meary’s angle apex) to plan an osteotomy through the apex (e.g. Cole/Japas-type) rather than at the hindfoot.",
      "explanation": "Correcting at the apex gives the most efficient correction and avoids creating secondary deformities. A viva trap is performing only hindfoot correction in a midfoot-driven cavus—this can leave the cavus and pressure symptoms unchanged.",

      "answer": "Fixation principles: stable fixation across the osteotomy (plates/screws as appropriate), maintain plantar soft tissues, and restore a plantigrade foot while preserving joint congruency where possible; consider bone graft if a gap is created. Counsel: nonunion, hardware irritation, and transfer metatarsalgia; also risk of neurovascular injury if plantar structures are violated.",
      "explanation": "Midfoot osteotomies have higher nonunion risk than simple first-ray procedures due to smaller bone segments and soft tissue constraints. Overcorrection can flatten the arch excessively and cause new pain. Protecting plantar structures is critical—plantar scarring can be very symptomatic.",

      "answer": "1) Identify driver: Coleman positive → forefoot-driven; do dorsiflexion 1st met osteotomy ± peroneus longus to brevis transfer; reassess heel and add lateralising calcaneal osteotomy if residual varus. 2) Coleman negative (fixed hindfoot varus) with preserved joints → lateralising calcaneal osteotomy ± midfoot osteotomy if apex midfoot; add soft tissue (gastrocnemius recession/TAL) if equinus. 3) If arthritis (subtalar/midfoot/ankle) or severe rigid deformity → consider appropriate arthrodesis (subtalar/triple/midfoot) rather than osteotomy. Add tendon transfers when there is demonstrable muscle imbalance/dynamic deformity to reduce recurrence.",
      "explanation": "The sequence matters: correct the driver first, then fine-tune residual deformity. Tendon transfers are adjuncts for balance, not primary correction in established cavus.

Choice depends on flexibility, location of deformity apex, presence of arthritis, bone stock, and neuromuscular progression.",
      "explanation": "Failed cavovarus surgery often reflects unrecognised driver (e.g. first ray), uncorrected equinus, or progressive neuromuscular disease.

      "question": "On weight-bearing assessment of cavovarus, which specific clinical and radiographic features help you distinguish a forefoot-driven cavus from a hindfoot-driven varus?",
      "answer": "Forefoot-driven: plantarflexed 1st ray, high medial arch, hindfoot varus that corrects on Coleman block; WB radiographs show increased Meary’s angle (apex at midfoot), increased calcaneal pitch, and forefoot plantarflexion relative to hindfoot. Hindfoot-driven: rigid hindfoot varus not correcting on Coleman block, often subtalar stiffness; radiographs show hindfoot varus alignment (e.g. Saltzman view) with less forefoot plantarflexion contribution.",
      "explanation": "The key decision is whether the hindfoot varus is compensatory (forefoot-driven) or primary/rigid (hindfoot-driven), because this dictates whether you correct the forefoot (1st ray/midfoot) or the hindfoot (calcaneus/subtalar). Pitfall: relying on non–weight-bearing films; cavus and hindfoot alignment are underappreciated without WB views.

      "answer": "Stand the patient with the lateral forefoot and heel on a block, allowing the 1st ray to hang free (unloaded). Positive: hindfoot varus corrects to neutral/valgus when the 1st ray is unloaded → forefoot-driven cavus; plan forefoot correction (e.g. dorsiflexion 1st met osteotomy ± midfoot osteotomy) and soft-tissue balancing rather than primary calcaneal osteotomy.",
      "explanation": "Unloading the plantarflexed 1st ray removes the varus-driving force; if the hindfoot corrects, it is flexible/compensatory. Common pitfall: placing the whole forefoot on the block (doesn’t unload the 1st ray) or judging correction without looking from behind. If the hindfoot remains in varus, you must address hindfoot alignment (calcaneal osteotomy or arthrodesis if rigid/arthritic).",

Strategy: correct deformity plus rebalance tendons (e.g. peroneus longus-to-brevis transfer, tibialis posterior transfer in selected cases) to reduce recurrence; avoid relying on bony correction alone.",

      "explanation": "The plantarflexed 1st ray acts as a varus post; correcting it often allows the hindfoot to realign without a calcaneal osteotomy.

Avoid excessive dorsiflexion (transfer metatarsalgia/1st MTP overload) and avoid elevating the 1st ray too little (persistent varus).",
      "explanation": "Stable fixation permits earlier functional rehab and reduces nonunion risk. Pitfalls: cutting through the plantar cortex (loss of hinge and shortening), and rotating the metatarsal (hallux malalignment).

Complications to avoid: sural neuritis/neuroma, peroneal tendon injury, nonunion, maltranslation, and painful hardware.",
      "explanation": "The sural nerve is at risk in the lateral hindfoot incision; careful dissection and incision placement reduce neuropathic pain.

      "question": "What factors make a patient a poor candidate for joint-preserving cavovarus reconstruction (osteotomies + tendon balancing), and what is the alternative strategy?",
      "answer": "Poor candidates: severe neuropathy/Charcot risk, uncontrolled diabetes/smoking with high nonunion risk, severe rigid deformity with multi-joint arthritis, poor soft tissues, or inability to comply with prolonged NWB. Alternative: bracing/orthoses if feasible; if surgery required, consider arthrodesis-based realignment (subtalar/triple) with robust fixation and realistic goals.",
      "explanation": "Joint-preserving surgery relies on healing and rehab; high-risk biology or noncompliance increases failure and wound problems. Pitfall: offering complex multi-osteotomy reconstruction to a patient who cannot remain NWB—loss of correction is likely. Arthrodesis can be more predictable for pain and alignment in end-stage or rigid disease, at the cost of motion.",

      "question": "In cavovarus assessment, what are the minimum weight-bearing radiographs you must obtain and what key measurements/signs do you look for to plan surgery?",
      "answer": "WB AP, lateral and hindfoot alignment (Saltzman) views of the foot/ankle (consider long-leg alignment if proximal deformity suspected). Look for Meary’s angle (talo–1st met axis), calcaneal pitch, forefoot-driven cavus (plantarflexed 1st ray), hindfoot varus on Saltzman, lateral column overload signs (5th met stress changes), ankle varus/medial joint space narrowing, and midfoot/Chopart arthritis.",
      "explanation": "Cavovarus is a 3D deformity; WB views show true alignment and where the apex is. Saltzman distinguishes hindfoot varus from forefoot-driven varus and is critical for choosing calcaneal osteotomy vs forefoot correction. A common viva trap is planning a calcaneal osteotomy without confirming whether the hindfoot varus is flexible and forefoot-driven. Always screen the ankle for varus arthritis because it changes goals and may require supramalleolar correction or fusion rather than foot-only procedures.",

      "answer": "Stand the patient with the heel and lateral border of the foot on a block, allowing the 1st ray to hang free. If hindfoot varus corrects to neutral/valgus = positive (forefoot-driven; correct the plantarflexed 1st ray ± midfoot). If hindfoot remains in varus = negative (true hindfoot varus; needs hindfoot correction e.g. calcaneal osteotomy ± subtalar procedures).",
      "explanation": "The test isolates the effect of a plantarflexed 1st ray on hindfoot position. A pitfall is placing the whole forefoot on the block, which prevents the 1st ray from dropping and gives a false-negative. Another trap is assuming a positive Coleman means 'no hindfoot surgery ever'—if residual hindfoot varus persists after forefoot correction, you may still need a calcaneal osteotomy.",

      "answer": "Neurological clues: intrinsic muscle wasting/claw toes, cavus in both feet, weak peroneals/tibialis anterior, sensory loss, absent reflexes, family history, and progressive deformity. Idiopathic/traumatic: unilateral, history of injury, more focal pain/arthritis, preserved power/sensation. It matters because neurological cavovarus is often progressive and muscle imbalance-driven, so tendon transfers and balancing are essential and recurrence risk is higher.",
      "explanation": "In CMT, bony correction alone fails if the deforming forces persist; you must rebalance (e.g. peroneus longus to brevis, tibialis posterior transfer in selected cases).

      "explanation": "The sequence matters: forefoot correction can secondarily correct hindfoot varus, avoiding unnecessary calcaneal shift.

      "explanation": "The osteotomy addresses the driver (plantarflexed 1st ray) and can realign the hindfoot indirectly.

Fix with a low-profile dorsal plate or two screws (lag/positional) ensuring stable compression. Avoid overcorrection by checking simulated WB alignment intra-op and ensuring the 1st met head is not elevated relative to 2nd (risk transfer metatarsalgia).",
      "explanation": "Stable fixation allows earlier mobilisation and reduces nonunion risk. The key is restoring plantar pressure under the 1st met head; too much dorsiflexion shifts load to lesser metatarsals.

Findings: heel remains in varus on standing and on Saltzman view; lateral column pain/peroneal symptoms; recurrent ankle sprains with varus heel; inability to evert to neutral (stiff subtalar).",
      "explanation": "A lateral shift repositions the heel under the tibia, reducing lateral border overload and improving peroneal mechanics.

Confirm heel alignment clinically and with fluoroscopy; avoid excessive shift (risk lateral impingement/peroneal irritation). Protect the peroneal tendons and avoid violating the subtalar joint.",
      "explanation": "Sural nerve injury and peroneal tendon irritation are common avoidable complications—meticulous soft tissue handling and screw placement matter.

Plan to correct the forefoot driver (e.g. dorsiflexion 1st met osteotomy or midfoot osteotomy at apex) and add hindfoot correction (lateralising calcaneal osteotomy) to address residual varus; also balance tendons and address equinus if present.",
      "explanation": "Partial correction is common and is a key decision point: doing only forefoot surgery risks persistent varus heel; doing only calcaneal shift risks persistent cavus and metatarsalgia.

      "answer": "Stage II: flexible hindfoot valgus and forefoot abduction/supination that corrects on heel-rise or passive inversion; no fixed subtalar/midfoot arthritis. Stage III: rigid hindfoot valgus with fixed forefoot abduction/supination, often with subtalar/midfoot arthritis and inability to correct. Stage II is treated with reconstruction (tendon + osteotomies/ligament); stage III usually needs fusion (typically triple or double arthrodesis) to correct a fixed deformity and address arthritis.",
      "explanation": "The key decision is flexibility: osteotomies and soft-tissue balancing rely on a correctable deformity.

      "answer": "Hindfoot valgus: hindfoot alignment view (Saltzman) showing calcaneal axis lateral to tibial axis; increased talo–first metatarsal angle on lateral (Meary’s) with plantar apex. Forefoot abduction: increased talonavicular uncoverage on AP (often >30–40%), increased AP talo–first metatarsal angle, and increased calcaneocuboid angle.

Add LCL when there is significant forefoot abduction (marked talonavicular uncoverage, “too many toes” sign) and lateral impingement/sinus tarsi pain, especially when MDCO alone would not restore talonavicular coverage.",
      "explanation": "MDCO shifts the heel under the tibia to reduce valgus and unload the medial column; it has limited effect on abduction.

Oblique osteotomy through posterior calcaneal tuberosity (posterior to posterior facet), then translate the posterior fragment medially typically 8–12 mm (titrate to hindfoot alignment). Fix with two large cannulated screws from posterior tuberosity into anterior calcaneus (or a plate), ensuring no subtalar joint penetration.",
      "explanation": "The osteotomy must be posterior enough to avoid the subtalar joint and allow translation.

CC distraction arthrodesis is considered when there is CC arthritis/instability or revision; it provides powerful correction but sacrifices CC motion and has nonunion risk.",

Check talonavicular coverage on AP, Meary’s line on lateral, and heel alignment; ensure the forefoot is not driven into varus. Avoid excessive lengthening and consider combining with MDCO rather than “bigger graft” to correct valgus.",
      "explanation": "Over-lengthening increases lateral plantar pressures and can precipitate CC arthritis and persistent lateral pain.

      "answer": "FDL transfer is appropriate when tibialis posterior is degenerate/insufficient but deformity remains flexible and joints are salvageable; it is an adjunct to bony realignment (not a standalone correction). Common fixation is into the navicular (or medial cuneiform) using a bone tunnel or interference screw/anchor, tensioned with the foot corrected (hindfoot neutral/varus as planned).",
      "explanation": "FDL is a synergist of tibialis posterior and can augment inversion, but it cannot correct malalignment without osteotomies.

Avoid by correcting hindfoot/forefoot first, using fluoroscopy for tunnel placement, tensioning with the foot plantigrade, and performing gastrocnemius recession/Achilles lengthening when Silfverskiöld indicates.",

Add repair/reconstruction when there is medial arch instability at the talonavicular joint that would otherwise leave residual talar head plantar-medial subluxation after osteotomies/FDL transfer.",

It is an opening wedge osteotomy through the dorsal medial cuneiform. Fix with a wedge graft (allograft/autograft) plus a dorsal plate or staple/screw construct to resist collapse and maintain plantarflexion.",

Use stable fixation (e.g., plantar plate plus dorsal screw/plate or crossed screws with good compression). Reduce nonunion risk by optimising biology (smoking cessation, vitamin D), preserving soft tissues, and ensuring rigid construct and appropriate post-op protection.",
      "explanation": "In PCFD the Lapidus is primarily a stability and sagittal plane tool; malposition (dorsiflexed first ray) causes transfer metatarsalgia and persistent collapse.

Aim to avoid over-lengthening, which can cause calcaneal gait and weakness; under-correction risks recurrence.",

Triple arthrodesis is preferred when CC arthritis/instability is present, deformity is severe, or prior lateral column procedures/degeneration exist. Principle: correct hindfoot valgus and forefoot abduction by reducing the talonavicular joint and aligning the heel under the tibia, then fuse in plantigrade alignment.",
      "explanation": "Talonavicular fusion is the keystone for correcting abduction; subtalar fusion corrects valgus and provides hindfoot stability.

Flexible stage IV may be treated with hindfoot reconstruction (MDCO/LCL as needed) plus deltoid/spring ligament reconstruction and possibly supramalleolar osteotomy if tibial plafond malalignment. Rigid/arthritic stage IV often requires ankle arthrodesis or total ankle replacement combined with hindfoot realignment/fusion (e.g., subtalar fusion) to create a stable plantigrade foot.",

Stage III: fixed hindfoot valgus/abduction with inability to correct; WB radiographs show subtalar/talonavicular/calcaneocuboid arthritis and fixed deformity.

      "question": "Describe key technical steps for MDCO in PCFD, preferred fixation, and how you avoid sural nerve and plantar neurovascular injury.",
      "answer": "Lateral approach centred over the calcaneal tuberosity; protect sural nerve posteriorly and avoid too plantar a dissection. Perform an oblique osteotomy through the tuberosity, translate the posterior fragment medially (often ~5–10 mm, tailored to hindfoot alignment), and fix with 1–2 large cannulated screws or a plate. Keep the saw cut controlled and avoid plunging plantarly; confirm translation and screw trajectory on fluoroscopy.",
      "explanation": "MDCO corrects valgus by medialising the Achilles pull and reducing subtalar eversion moment. Sural nerve injury is a common pitfall with a posterior-lateral incision; plantar structures are at risk if the saw exits plantarly or retractors are placed too deep. Another trap is inadequate translation—radiographic hindfoot alignment view helps quantify correction.",

      "question": "For an Evans (anterior calcaneal) LCL in stage II PCFD, where is the osteotomy made, what graft/implant options exist, and what complication drives graft size selection?",
      "answer": "Osteotomy is made in the anterior calcaneus ~1.5 cm proximal to the CC joint, opening laterally to lengthen the lateral column. Options: tricortical iliac crest autograft, allograft wedge, or porous metal wedge; fixation often with a plate or staple/screws. Key complication is CC joint overload/arthritis and lateral foot pain—avoid excessive lengthening (commonly aim ~6–10 mm, titrated to TN coverage and forefoot position).",
      "explanation": "LCL primarily corrects forefoot abduction at the TN joint; too large a wedge increases lateral plantar pressures and stresses the CC joint. Pitfall: placing the osteotomy too close to the CC joint causing joint violation and early arthritis. Intra-op assessment includes TN coverage on AP and forefoot supination—if supination appears, you may need medial column plantarflexion rather than more lengthening.",

      "answer": "Address with a plantarflexion procedure of the medial column. Cotton (opening wedge medial cuneiform) is for flexible medial column/forefoot varus without 1st ray instability or TMT arthritis. 1st TMT (Lapidus) fusion is preferred if there is 1st ray hypermobility, TMT arthritis, or significant medial column instability requiring durable correction.",

      "answer": "Indicated when tibialis posterior is dysfunctional/attenuated but deformity remains flexible (stage II) and joints are salvageable. FDL is typically transferred to the navicular (often through a drill hole or suture anchor) to augment medial support. Must correct bony alignment (MDCO ± LCL and any medial column procedure) and address spring ligament/medial soft tissues as needed; tendon transfer alone fails due to persistent deforming forces.",
      "explanation": "FDL is a dynamic support but is weaker than tibialis posterior; without realignment it is overloaded and stretches out.

      "answer": "Pitfalls: (1) injuring or overtensioning the FHL/FDL slip connections leading to clawing/weak toe flexion; mitigate by careful identification and preserving the master knot of Henry region and appropriate tensioning. (2) Inadequate fixation/poor tendon purchase in the navicular causing pull-out; mitigate with robust fixation (tunnel + interference/suture, or multiple anchors) and ensuring adequate tendon length and bone quality.",
      "explanation": "Toe morbidity is a common viva point: most patients tolerate some loss of lesser toe flexion, but excessive tensioning can cause symptomatic deformity. Fixation failure is more likely if the navicular bone is osteopenic or the tunnel is malpositioned. Also avoid placing fixation too plantar-medial where hardware can irritate the medial plantar nerve/skin.",

Add repair/reconstruction when medial soft-tissue insufficiency persists after alignment correction, especially in stage II with significant TN instability, to reduce recurrence and improve TN congruency.",
      "explanation": "The spring ligament is a key static restraint of the talar head; if incompetent, tendon transfer and osteotomies may not maintain TN reduction.

Key complication is over-lengthening causing calcaneal gait/weak push-off and worsening midfoot collapse; aim for neutral to 5–10° dorsiflexion.",
      "explanation": "Equinus increases midfoot pronation forces and contributes to deformity and failure of reconstruction.

      "answer": "NC fusion: collapse/instability or arthritis at the NC joint with sag at the medial midfoot (often seen as plantar gapping/instability and persistent Meary’s angle). 1st TMT fusion: 1st ray hypermobility, TMT arthritis, or hallux valgus/instability contributing to medial column collapse. Alignment goal: restore a plantigrade foot with corrected Meary’s angle and eliminate residual forefoot varus/supination after hindfoot correction.",
      "explanation": "Choosing the correct fusion level treats the driver of collapse; fusing the wrong joint risks nonunion and persistent deformity.

      "answer": "Double arthrodesis (subtalar + talonavicular) is considered if the calcaneocuboid (CC) joint is preserved and not painful/arthritic. Triple arthrodesis includes CC fusion when CC joint shows arthritis, subluxation, or lateral column pain/impingement. Pre-op WB radiographs/CT showing CC joint degeneration or incongruity pushes inclusion of CC.",
      "explanation": "TN fusion is the key to correcting abduction and restoring the medial arch; adding CC fusion increases stiffness and nonunion risk but may be necessary for pain relief and stability.

Strategy must address the ankle: options include deltoid reconstruction and hindfoot realignment/fusion if ankle joint is preserved, or ankle arthrodesis/total ankle replacement with concomitant hindfoot procedures in selected cases. Stage II/III procedures alone (MDCO/LCL/FDL) are insufficient if the ankle is unstable or arthritic.",

Sequence matters because bony correction changes soft-tissue tension and reveals residual deformity; doing tendon/ligament work before alignment risks mal-tensioning and recurrence.",
      "explanation": "Bony procedures set the platform; soft tissues then stabilise the corrected alignment.

Stage III: fixed hindfoot valgus/forefoot abduction with subtalar/midtarsal rigidity and degenerative changes (subtalar/talonavicular/calcaneocuboid arthritis) on WB radiographs.

      "explanation": "The key decision is flexibility and presence of arthritis: osteotomies and soft-tissue reconstruction rely on mobile joints to realign the foot.

      "question": "Describe the key technical steps and fixation principles for MDCO in PCFD, including how you avoid sural nerve injury and how much translation is typically aimed for.",
      "answer": "Oblique posterior calcaneal osteotomy through the tuberosity, typically via a lateral approach; protect the sural nerve and small saphenous vein by staying anterior to them and using blunt dissection. Translate the posterior fragment medially (often ~5–10 mm, tailored to hindfoot alignment view/clinical correction) and fix with 1–2 large cannulated screws or a plate, ensuring compression and avoiding plantar screw prominence.",
      "explanation": "MDCO corrects valgus by medialising the Achilles pull and reducing subtalar eversion moment. Pitfalls: inadequate translation (persistent valgus), excessive translation (varus/overload), and sural nerve neurapraxia from a posterior-lateral incision. Confirm correction clinically and with intra-op hindfoot alignment; ensure screws do not violate the subtalar joint.",

      "question": "For an Evans-type lateral column lengthening in stage II PCFD, where is the osteotomy placed, what graft/implant options exist, and what complication most strongly influences how much you lengthen?",
      "answer": "Osteotomy is typically in the anterior calcaneus ~1.5 cm proximal to the calcaneocuboid joint, opened laterally. Options: tricortical iliac crest autograft, allograft wedge, or porous metal wedge with/without plate/screw fixation. The key limiting complication is lateral column overload/calcaneocuboid joint pain/arthritis (and subluxation), so lengthening is titrated to restore TN coverage without overcorrection.",
      "explanation": "The goal is to reduce talonavicular abduction and improve forefoot alignment; too much lengthening increases lateral plantar pressures and CC joint stress. A viva trap is ignoring pre-existing CC arthritis—LCL can worsen symptoms; consider alternative strategies (e.g., arthrodesis or different osteotomy plan). Intra-op fluoroscopy should confirm TN coverage and avoid CC joint violation.",

      "question": "What is the rationale for FDL transfer in PTTD/PCFD, where is it typically fixed, and what is the key caveat about using FDL transfer as a standalone procedure?",
      "answer": "FDL transfer augments a deficient tibialis posterior to restore dynamic inversion/support of the medial arch. It is typically fixed into the navicular (or medial cuneiform) via a bone tunnel/tenodesis screw/suture anchor. It should not be used alone in stage II deformity—bony realignment (MDCO ± LCL ± medial column procedure) is usually required to correct the deforming forces and prevent failure.",
      "explanation": "FDL is a synergist of tibialis posterior and is expendable; transfer improves function but cannot correct established structural malalignment. The common pitfall is offering “FDL transfer only” for a collapsed, abducted foot—patients remain flat and painful.

      "answer": "Use a secure fixation method (interference screw or well-placed bone tunnel with robust sutures) with the tendon seated within bone; bury knots away from shoe-wear areas and avoid prominent anchors. Tension with the hindfoot corrected (after osteotomies) and the foot held in slight inversion/plantarflexion to avoid slack; confirm that the transfer is not over-tensioned causing inversion stiffness.",
      "explanation": "Tensioning before bony correction leads to mal-tension and either persistent collapse (too loose) or painful overcorrection (too tight). Knot/anchor prominence over the navicular is a common cause of medial shoe irritation. Another pitfall is failing to debride diseased tibialis posterior and leaving a painful tendon stump.",

      "answer": "Suspect spring ligament failure with marked talar head uncovering/medial bulge, persistent talonavicular sag/abduction despite hindfoot correction, and tenderness over the plantar-medial talonavicular region. Operatively, add spring ligament repair/reconstruction (often with suture anchors/augmentation) alongside realignment osteotomies and tendon augmentation; do not rely on FDL transfer alone.",
      "explanation": "The spring ligament is a key static stabiliser of the talar head; if incompetent, the talus plantarflexes and the arch collapses even if the hindfoot is corrected. A trap is correcting valgus with MDCO but leaving TN instability—patients remain symptomatic with residual “midfoot break.” Consider MRI/US if diagnosis is uncertain, but decision is often made intra-operatively based on instability.",

      "question": "What are the common reasons spring ligament repair fails in PCFD surgery, and how do you mitigate them?",
      "answer": "Failures commonly occur due to uncorrected bony malalignment (persistent abduction/valgus), under-addressed medial column instability, poor tissue quality/attenuation, and inadequate protection during healing. Mitigate by correcting alignment first (MDCO ± LCL), adding medial column stabilisation when needed, using augmentation/reconstruction rather than simple plication in poor tissue, and enforcing staged rehabilitation with immobilisation and delayed strengthening.",
      "explanation": "Spring ligament repair is load-sensitive; if the talar head remains uncovered, the repair is overloaded and stretches out.

      "answer": "Indications: residual forefoot varus/supination after hindfoot realignment, medial column instability/hypermobility, or plantar gapping at the first TMT on WB radiographs. Choose Cotton (opening wedge plantarflexion osteotomy of medial cuneiform) when the first ray is flexible without significant TMT arthritis/instability; choose first TMT fusion when there is symptomatic arthritis, clear instability, or severe hypermobility requiring durable stabilisation.",
      "explanation": "Correcting the hindfoot can unmask forefoot varus; if left, patients overload the lateral border or re-collapse medially. Cotton is joint-sparing but can fail if instability is the driver; TMT fusion is more definitive but risks nonunion and transfer metatarsalgia if malpositioned.

      "question": "For a Cotton osteotomy in PCFD, what is the intended correction, where is the cut made, and what are the key pitfalls that lead to persistent symptoms?",
      "answer": "Intended correction is plantarflexion of the medial column to correct residual forefoot varus/supination. The cut is an opening wedge osteotomy through the medial cuneiform (dorsal opening), typically filled with a wedge graft/implant. Pitfalls: using it to treat true first TMT instability (leading to recurrence), over-plantarflexing (transfer metatarsalgia), and inadequate fixation/graft leading to collapse or nonunion.",
      "explanation": "Cotton addresses sagittal plane forefoot alignment after hindfoot correction; it is not a substitute for stabilising an unstable TMT joint.

      "answer": "Aim for a plantigrade first ray with appropriate dorsiflexion/plantarflexion and slight valgus/neutral rotation; avoid elevating the first metatarsal. Fixation commonly uses a plantar or dorsomedial plate with compression (often plus an interfragmentary screw) to resist dorsiflexion forces. Ensure good joint preparation and compression to reduce nonunion risk.",
      "explanation": "The first ray is a key medial column strut; if fused in dorsiflexion (elevated), load shifts laterally causing transfer metatarsalgia and persistent arch collapse. Plantar plating can be biomechanically advantageous but requires careful soft-tissue handling.

      "question": "How do you decide between gastrocnemius recession and tendo-Achilles lengthening in PCFD reconstruction, and what is the key complication to avoid?",
      "answer": "Use Silfverskiöld test: isolated gastrocnemius tightness (dorsiflexion improves with knee flexion) → gastrocnemius recession; combined gastro-soleus tightness (limited dorsiflexion regardless of knee position) → tendo-Achilles lengthening. Key complication to avoid is over-lengthening causing calcaneal gait/weak push-off and worsening function.",
      "explanation": "Equinus increases midfoot collapse forces and can jeopardise reconstructions; addressing it reduces recurrence risk.

      "answer": "Triple arthrodesis is preferred when there is multi-joint hindfoot/midtarsal arthritis or severe rigid deformity involving subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints. Selective fusion (e.g., subtalar + TN, or TN alone) may be used when arthritis is limited and correction can be achieved while preserving uninvolved joints. At fusion you must correct hindfoot valgus, forefoot abduction, and medial column alignment to a plantigrade foot; address equinus if present.",
      "explanation": "TN joint is a key “lock” for hindfoot motion; fusing it alone can correct abduction but may overload adjacent joints if deformity is severe.

      "answer": "Stage IV includes ankle involvement (tibiotalar valgus/tilt) due to deltoid insufficiency, so treating only the foot risks persistent ankle pain and progression. Options include foot realignment/fusion plus deltoid reconstruction in flexible ankle deformity, or combined procedures for end-stage ankle arthritis: ankle arthrodesis or total ankle replacement with concomitant hindfoot realignment/fusions as needed.",
      "explanation": "The ankle becomes part of the deformity chain; correcting the hindfoot can improve ankle alignment in some flexible cases, but fixed talar tilt/arthritis needs direct ankle management.

      "answer": "Typical sequence: (1) assess and address equinus (gastrocnemius recession/TAL if needed), (2) bony realignment—MDCO ± LCL to correct hindfoot valgus and forefoot abduction, (3) reassess forefoot; perform medial column procedure if residual forefoot varus/supination, (4) spring ligament repair/reconstruction if TN instability persists, (5) FDL transfer/tenodesis and tibialis posterior debridement. Sequence matters because soft-tissue tensioning and the need for medial column work depend on corrected bony alignment.",
      "explanation": "If you tension FDL or repair spring ligament before correcting abduction/valgus, you risk mal-tension, overconstraint, or early failure. Reassessment after each step is key—particularly forefoot position after hindfoot correction.

      "answer": "(a) Undercorrection: persistent hindfoot valgus/too-many-toes, ongoing medial pain, lateral impingement—often from insufficient MDCO translation or inadequate LCL/medial column correction. (b) Overcorrection: hindfoot varus, lateral foot overload, peroneal pain—often from excessive MDCO shift or over-lengthened LCL. Prevent by stepwise correction with repeated clinical assessment (heel alignment, forefoot plantigrade) and fluoroscopic checks of TN coverage and hindfoot alignment; avoid “fixed” graft sizes without titration.",
      "explanation": "PCFD correction is multiplanar; correcting one plane excessively to compensate for another creates new pathology.

Salvage options: add/redo osteotomies (LCL, revision MDCO), medial column stabilisation (Cotton or TMT fusion), spring ligament reconstruction, gastrocnemius recession/TAL, and if rigid/arthritic convert to selective or triple arthrodesis; address ankle pathology if stage IV.",
      "explanation": "FDL transfer can mask symptoms early but fails if alignment is not corrected; revision planning must re-stage the deformity and reassess flexibility and arthritis.

WB radiographs show increased talo–1st metatarsal angle and talonavicular uncoverage; subtalar and ankle joints are preserved. How do you choose between MDCO, lateral column lengthening (Evans), and medial column procedures, and what is your standard reconstruction construct (including tendon/ligament work)?",
      "answer": "This is flexible PCFD (Stage II). Choose procedures by the dominant plane of deformity on WB imaging/clinical exam: (1) Hindfoot valgus (heel valgus, increased hindfoot moment arm) → medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy (MDCO) to shift the heel under the tibia and reduce valgus/pronation. (2) Forefoot abduction (high talonavicular uncoverage, increased AP talo–1st MT angle, “too many toes”) → lateral column lengthening (LCL, usually Evans at ~1.5 cm proximal to CC joint) to reduce abduction; avoid overlengthening. (3) Residual forefoot supination/medial column instability after hindfoot correction (plantar gapping at 1st TMT/naviculocuneiform, persistent elevated 1st ray) → medial column plantarflexion procedure (Cotton opening wedge medial cuneiform osteotomy if joints are stable; 1st TMT or naviculocuneiform fusion if arthritic/unstable). Soft tissue: debride/tenosynovectomy of tibialis posterior; FDL transfer to navicular (often with a bone tunnel/anchor) as a dynamic substitute; address spring ligament if incompetent (repair/reefing or augmentation) especially if talar head uncoverage persists. Typical construct for Stage IIb (valgus + abduction): MDCO + Evans LCL + FDL transfer ± spring ligament repair; add Cotton or medial column fusion if forefoot varus/supination remains. Contraindications: rigid deformity/arthritis (Stage III) → hindfoot fusion; ankle valgus/arthritis (Stage IV) → deltoid/ankle procedures or TTC/ankle fusion/arthroplasty depending on case.",
      "explanation": "The viva trap is treating all Stage II the same: MDCO mainly corrects hindfoot valgus but does little for forefoot abduction, whereas Evans LCL primarily corrects abduction by rotating the forefoot/hindfoot complex around the talus. Another common pitfall is overlengthening the lateral column, causing lateral foot pain, calcaneocuboid overload/arthritis, and stiffness—aim for radiographic correction (talonavicular coverage) rather than a fixed graft size. Medial column procedures are not “optional extras”: if you correct the hindfoot/abduction but leave a supinated forefoot or unstable 1st ray, the patient remains symptomatic and the reconstruction fails. FDL transfer improves inversion power but does not correct deformity alone; spring ligament incompetence is a key driver of talar head uncoverage and should be repaired/augmented when lax to avoid recurrence.",

      "question": "What is the clinical relevance of sesamoid displacement on WB AP radiographs in hallux valgus, and how does it influence choice of procedure and recurrence risk?",
      "answer": "Lateral sesamoid displacement (and failure to reduce sesamoids under the 1st metatarsal head) indicates significant metatarsal pronation/soft-tissue imbalance and correlates with recurrence. Procedures that reliably recentre the sesamoids (adequate lateral release + appropriate osteotomy/translation or Lapidus if unstable TMT1) reduce recurrence risk.",
      "explanation": "A common pitfall is correcting the HVA/IMA numerically while leaving the sesamoids lateral—this often recurs. Severe sesamoid subluxation suggests a more powerful correction than a simple distal osteotomy alone. Also consider that pronation is a 3D deformity; AP angles alone may miss it.",

      "question": "When is DMAA assessment important in hallux valgus, and how does an increased DMAA change your operative plan?",
      "answer": "DMAA matters when the MTP joint is incongruent or the metatarsal head articular surface is tilted. A high DMAA may require a rotational component (e.g., biplanar scarf/chevron modification) to realign the articular surface; otherwise you risk a cosmetically straight toe with persistent joint incongruency and recurrence.",

      "question": "How do you assess 1st TMT (first ray) instability clinically and radiographically, and why does it push you towards a Lapidus rather than a distal/metatarsal osteotomy?",
      "answer": "Clinically: excessive dorsiflexion/translation of the 1st metatarsal relative to the lesser rays (compared side-to-side), often with callosity under 2nd metatarsal. Radiographically: increased IMA, TMT1 joint incongruency/arthritis, and sometimes plantar gapping/dorsal subluxation on WB lateral. Instability is a driver of recurrence; Lapidus addresses the deformity at its apex and stabilises the first ray.",
      "explanation": "The key is matching the procedure to the deformity driver: if the base is unstable, distal correction alone can drift back.

Scarf: moderate deformity needing greater IMA correction/translation, good bone quality, preserved MTP; often add Akin for residual phalangeal valgus.

It corrects phalangeal valgus and improves toe alignment without further altering IMA.",
      "explanation": "A common pitfall is using Akin to compensate for under-correction of the metatarsal/first ray—this can leave sesamoids unreduced and recurrence likely.

V-shaped osteotomy at the metatarsal head with apex centred; translate the head laterally (typically up to ~50% width) and fix with a screw or K-wire. Preserve lateral soft-tissue attachments and avoid extensive periosteal stripping to reduce AVN risk; perform controlled lateral release if needed.",
      "explanation": "AVN risk increases with aggressive dissection and disruption of head blood supply; keep the osteotomy stable and soft tissues respected.

      "answer": "Troughing occurs when the plantar fragment sinks into the cancellous bone of the opposite cortex, often from a too-central cut, narrow dorsal/plantar limbs, osteopenia, or excessive translation. Prevent by making long, well-planned cuts with adequate cortical purchase, keeping the osteotomy in stronger bone, avoiding over-translation, and using stable fixation (typically two screws) with correct compression and rotational control.",
      "explanation": "Troughing leads to loss of correction, elevation/shortening of the first metatarsal, and transfer metatarsalgia.

Consider bone graft if there is bone loss or revision.",
      "explanation": "Nonunion is the major concern—risk factors include smoking, diabetes, poor fixation, and inadequate joint preparation/compression.

Avoid by minimal bone resection, maintaining plantarflexion of the first ray, correcting rotation/pronation, confirming sesamoid reduction and MTP congruency, and checking simulated WB alignment before final fixation.",

Contraindications/relative cautions: active infection, severe vascular compromise, inability to comply with post-op restrictions; caution in heavy smokers/poor bone quality due to nonunion risk.",

Fixation: compression screw plus dorsal plate (or crossed screws) after thorough joint preparation; aim for rigid compression and rotational control.",
      "explanation": "Malposition is a classic viva trap: too much dorsiflexion causes shoe wear pain/transfer load; too plantarflexed causes toe-tip pressure; too much valgus impinges on second toe; rotation causes nail/skin problems.

Also consider bone stock, sesamoid position, soft-tissue balance, infection risk, and patient factors affecting union.",
      "explanation": "Revision is diagnosis-driven: identify whether pain is from arthritis, malalignment, hardware, or transfer metatarsalgia.

      "answer": "Perform a V-shaped osteotomy in the distal metatarsal with apex centred in the head; keep plantar limb longer for inherent stability. Limit soft-tissue stripping, preserve plantar blood supply, and avoid excessive lateral release. Translate the head laterally (typically up to ~50% width) and fix with a screw/K-wire as needed.",
      "explanation": "Chevron is stable when the plantar limb is long and the head remains well perfused. AVN risk rises with aggressive capsulotomy/periosteal stripping and extensive lateral release. Pitfall: over-translation can compromise contact area and lead to troughing/instability.",

      "question": "What is 'troughing' in a scarf osteotomy, what increases its risk, and how do you prevent it?",
      "answer": "Troughing is collapse/impaction of the dorsal and plantar cortices into cancellous bone leading to loss of correction and elevation/shortening of the 1st metatarsal. Risk increases with osteoporotic bone, narrow metatarsals, overly central cuts, and excessive translation. Prevent by keeping cuts close to cortices, maintaining adequate plantar shelf, avoiding over-translation, and using stable screw fixation.",
      "explanation": "Scarf relies on cortical buttress; if the cortices are not preserved, the construct can settle.

Before closure: confirm sesamoid reduction, MTP congruency, metatarsal length/plantarflexion (avoid elevation), and hallux alignment through ROM.",
      "explanation": "Fixation must resist shear and rotation during early mobilisation. Pitfalls include intra-articular screw placement and elevating the first metatarsal causing transfer metatarsalgia. In viva, mention intra-op fluoroscopy views (AP, lateral, sesamoid/axial if available).",

      "answer": "Medial closing-wedge osteotomy in the proximal phalanx (usually proximal third), preserving the lateral cortex as a hinge. Fixation options: staple, screw, or K-wire; stable fixation reduces displacement. Unstable constructs risk lateral cortex fracture with loss of correction and nonunion/malunion.",

      "explanation": "The first ray must accept load in stance; elevation makes the lesser metatarsals overload. A viva trap is focusing only on AP correction (IMA) and ignoring sagittal plane.

      "answer": "Prefer MTP fusion when there is moderate–severe MTP arthritis, significant stiffness/pain, inflammatory arthropathy, failed prior bunion surgery with joint degeneration, or severe deformity where a durable correction is needed. Osteotomies are better when cartilage is preserved and the goal is joint preservation.",

      "answer": "Aim: ~10–15° valgus, ~10–15° dorsiflexion relative to the floor (or to the 1st metatarsal depending on method), neutral rotation with the nail plate facing dorsally. Too much dorsiflexion causes shoe-wear pressure and inability to toe-off; too little dorsiflexion causes toe catching. Too much valgus causes 2nd toe impingement; varus causes medial shoe pressure.",

      "answer": "Reliable constructs: dorsal plate with interfragmentary compression screw (or crossed screws with compression). Nonunion causes: inadequate joint preparation, poor compression, malposition with high stress, smoking, neuropathy/diabetes, and early excessive loading.",
      "explanation": "A plate-plus-screw construct improves resistance to dorsiflexion bending forces during gait.

      "answer": "(a) Recurrence: under-correction of IMA, failure to address TMT instability/pronation, inadequate sesamoid reduction, or loss of correction (e.g. scarf troughing). Prevent by matching procedure to deformity (consider Lapidus) and confirming sesamoid reduction/alignment intra-op. (b) Hallux varus: over-medial capsulorrhaphy, excessive lateral release, overcorrection with Akin, or over-translation. Prevent with stepwise soft-tissue balancing and avoiding aggressive release in mild deformity.",
      "explanation": "Examiners look for recognition that recurrence is often a planning error (wrong operation) rather than “bad luck”. Hallux varus is usually iatrogenic and difficult to treat; prevention is critical.

      "question": "On weight-bearing AP foot radiographs, how do you measure HVA and IMA, and what are typical thresholds for mild/moderate/severe deformity used for procedure selection?",
      "answer": "HVA: angle between longitudinal axes of 1st metatarsal and proximal phalanx. IMA: angle between longitudinal axes of 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Typical cut-offs: mild HVA <20° and IMA <11°; moderate HVA 20–40° and IMA 11–16°; severe HVA >40° and/or IMA >16° (plus consider TMT1 instability).",
      "explanation": "Always use weight-bearing radiographs; non-WB underestimates deformity and can mislead procedure choice. The angles guide whether a distal metatarsal osteotomy (e.g. chevron), diaphyseal osteotomy (scarf), or a proximal correction (Lapidus) is required.

      "question": "What is sesamoid position grading on WB AP radiographs, and why does it matter for hallux valgus surgery?",
      "answer": "Sesamoid position is commonly graded relative to the 1st metatarsal axis (e.g. Hardy–Clapham 1–7): increasing lateral displacement indicates worse deformity. Goal is sesamoid reduction under the 1st metatarsal head; persistent lateral sesamoids predict recurrence and ongoing pain.",
      "explanation": "Hallux valgus is largely a metatarsal varus/sesamoid subluxation problem; correcting HVA/IMA without reducing sesamoids risks recurrence.

      "question": "What is the distal metatarsal articular angle (DMAA), how is it measured, and how does it influence procedure choice?",
      "answer": "DMAA is the angle between the 1st metatarsal longitudinal axis and the line of the distal metatarsal articular surface. Increased DMAA suggests an incongruent joint with lateral tilt of the metatarsal head; consider procedures that can correct distal articular orientation (e.g. biplanar chevron/scarf with rotational component) rather than relying on soft-tissue balancing alone.",
      "explanation": "High DMAA contributes to persistent valgus even if IMA is corrected.

      "answer": "Clinically: increased dorsal-plantar mobility of the first ray compared with the second (manual stress), often with transfer metatarsalgia/callosities. Radiographically: increased IMA, TMT1 subluxation/diastasis, plantar gapping or sagittal malalignment on lateral views; sometimes metatarsus primus elevatus. If unstable/hypermobile or severe IMA, favour Lapidus (TMT1 fusion) over distal/shaft osteotomy.",
      "explanation": "Lapidus addresses the deformity driver at the TMT1 joint and reduces recurrence risk in unstable first rays.

Lapidus: severe IMA, TMT1 instability/arthritis, recurrent HV, or significant first ray sagittal malalignment. MTP fusion: end-stage MTP arthritis (hallux rigidus/arthritic HV), severe deformity in low-demand/older patients, neuromuscular/inflammatory disease, or failed prior bunion surgery with poor joint.",

Avoid excessive stripping and avoid cutting too proximal. Maintain metatarsal length and avoid dorsal malunion.",

Typically release adductor hallucis tendon insertion and lateral capsular structures; consider intersesamoid ligament as needed. Avoid over-release that can cause hallux varus and preserve metatarsal head vascularity.",
      "explanation": "Adequate lateral release helps sesamoid reduction, but overdoing it is a common cause of iatrogenic hallux varus.

Avoid a too-thin plantar fragment, overly vertical cuts, and inadequate cortical contact. Ensure correct rotation/translation to reduce IMA and sesamoids.",

      "answer": "Causes: over-aggressive lateral release, excessive medial capsulorrhaphy, overcorrection with osteotomy (too much translation/rotation), and overzealous Akin wedge. Prevention: titrate lateral release to reducibility, avoid overtight medial repair, aim for slight valgus alignment, and check dynamic alignment/ROM before closure.",
      "explanation": "Hallux varus is difficult to treat and often iatrogenic; prevention is key. Viva trap: assuming hallux varus is only from lateral release—medial tightening and bony overcorrection are equally common. Always reassess toe position after fixation and capsular work.",

      "answer": "Predictors: under-corrected IMA, persistent lateral sesamoids, unaddressed TMT1 instability, high DMAA/incongruent joint not corrected, and inadequate soft-tissue balancing; also poor compliance and ligamentous laxity. Mitigation: choose an appropriately powerful procedure (scarf/Lapidus when indicated), ensure sesamoid reduction, correct rotation, and avoid leaving TMT1 instability untreated.",

Prevention: preserve length, avoid troughing/elevation (especially scarf), ensure plantarflexion of first ray when needed (Lapidus), and confirm sagittal alignment on lateral fluoroscopy.",
      "explanation": "Transfer metatarsalgia is usually iatrogenic from altering first ray load-sharing.

      "answer": "Indications: painful arthritic MTP joint with deformity (including failed bunion surgery), inflammatory arthropathy, severe deformity with poor joint surfaces, and cases where durable correction is needed. Position: neutral rotation, ~10–15° valgus, and ~10–15° dorsiflexion relative to the floor (or to match footwear), with the toe just off the ground on simulated weight-bearing.",
      "explanation": "Fusion provides reliable pain relief and deformity correction when the joint is not salvageable.

Nonunion risks: smoking, poor vascularity, inflammatory disease, diabetes, poor bone quality, inadequate joint preparation/compression, and early excessive loading.",
      "explanation": "MTP fusion is mechanically demanding; compression and stability are critical. Viva trap: forgetting to address hallux rotation/pronation—fusion can lock in malrotation causing nail/skin problems.

      "question": "On weight-bearing AP forefoot radiographs, how do you measure HVA, IMA and DMAA, what are typical severity cut-offs, and what common measurement pitfalls change procedure choice?",
      "answer": "HVA: angle between long axis of 1st metatarsal and proximal phalanx. IMA: angle between long axes of 1st and 2nd metatarsals. DMAA: angle between distal metatarsal articular surface line and perpendicular to 1st metatarsal axis. Typical severity: mild HVA <20°, IMA <11°; moderate HVA 20–40°, IMA 11–16°; severe HVA >40°, IMA >16°. Pitfalls: non–weight-bearing films underestimate deformity; pronation of the 1st metatarsal can falsely elevate DMAA; hallux valgus interphalangeus can be missed without assessing phalangeal alignment; sesamoid position and 1st TMT instability (on WB views) influence whether distal osteotomy is sufficient vs Lapidus.",
      "explanation": "Procedure selection hinges on where the deformity is: distal (DMAA) vs metatarsal shaft (IMA) vs proximal (TMT instability). WB radiographs are essential; non-WB can make a severe deformity look moderate and lead to under-correction. Apparent high DMAA may reflect metatarsal pronation rather than true distal articular malorientation—this is a common viva trap and can lead to unnecessary distal articular correction. Always correlate angles with clinical pronation, sesamoid subluxation and TMT hypermobility to avoid choosing a distal chevron for a deformity driven proximally.",

      "question": "In a symptomatic moderate hallux valgus, what radiographic/clinical features push you towards distal chevron versus Scarf osteotomy, and when do you add an Akin?",
      "answer": "Distal chevron: best for mild–moderate deformity with relatively low IMA (typically ≤13–14°), congruent MTP joint, minimal first-ray instability, and need mainly for lateral translation of the metatarsal head. Scarf: preferred when more powerful IMA correction is needed (often ~13–16°), when you want stable fixation allowing earlier mobilisation, or when there is metatarsal pronation/translation requiring greater control; avoid if very osteoporotic or very severe deformity where correction demands are excessive. Add Akin when there is hallux valgus interphalangeus (increased hallux interphalangeal angle), persistent phalangeal valgus after metatarsal correction, or to fine-tune residual HVA; ensure not to overcorrect into hallux varus.",
      "explanation": "Chevron is a distal, inherently stable V-osteotomy but has limited power for IMA correction; using it for a high IMA risks recurrence. Scarf provides greater translational and rotational control but is technique-sensitive; troughing and dorsal malunion are classic pitfalls. Akin is not a substitute for correcting a high IMA—adding it to mask an under-corrected metatarsal is a common trap and increases risk of varus. Always reassess alignment after metatarsal correction before committing to Akin.",

      "answer": "Indications: severe HV with high IMA, first-ray hypermobility/1st TMT instability, recurrence after distal/metatarsal osteotomy, associated 1st TMT arthritis, and deformity driven proximally. Relative contraindications: poor bone/vascularity, uncontrolled diabetes/neuropathy, active smoking (high nonunion risk), and inability to comply with protected weight-bearing. Nonunion/transfer metatarsalgia avoidance: meticulous joint preparation to bleeding cancellous surfaces, correct 1st metatarsal length/plantarflexion (avoid dorsiflexion), correct rotation/pronation, compressive fixation (e.g., plantar plate plus dorsal screw/plate or two crossed screws with compression), and confirm sesamoid reduction and forefoot parabola intra-op.",
      "explanation": "Lapidus corrects the deformity at its source when the first ray is unstable; doing a distal osteotomy in this setting often recurs. The common technical failure is fusing the first metatarsal dorsiflexed or shortened, which overloads the lesser metatarsals and causes transfer metatarsalgia. Nonunion is the major complication—risk is amplified by smoking and inadequate compression/surface prep.

      "question": "For hallux valgus with symptomatic 1st MTP arthritis, what are the indications for 1st MTP fusion, what alignment targets do you aim for, and what fixation choices minimise nonunion and malposition?",
      "answer": "Indications: painful end-stage 1st MTP arthritis with deformity (including severe HV), inflammatory arthropathy, failed prior bunion surgery with joint degeneration/instability, and salvage of iatrogenic hallux varus/recurrence when joint preservation is unsuitable. Alignment targets: neutral to slight valgus of the hallux (about 5–15°), slight dorsiflexion to allow toe clearance and push-off (often ~10–15° relative to floor/shoe), and correct rotation so the nail faces dorsally and the pulp contacts the ground. Fixation: dorsal plate with interfragmentary compression screw (or equivalent compression construct) is common; ensure broad surface preparation, compression, and avoid excessive shortening; check position clinically with simulated weight-bearing before final fixation.",
      "explanation": "Fusion is predictable pain relief and deformity correction when the joint is arthritic; osteotomies in a degenerate joint are a set-up for persistent pain. Malposition is the classic trap: too much dorsiflexion causes shoe-wear problems and IP overload; too little dorsiflexion causes toe-stubbing; too much valgus risks impingement on the 2nd toe.

      "question": "After chevron/Scarf/Akin or Lapidus, a patient develops hallux varus or recurrence: what are the common technical causes for each, and what are pragmatic early and late salvage options?",
      "answer": "Hallux varus causes: over-resection of medial eminence, over-tight medial capsulorrhaphy, excessive lateral release (especially adductor/ lateral sesamoid complex), overcorrection with Akin, or over-translation/rotation of the metatarsal head. Recurrence causes: under-corrected IMA (wrong procedure for severity), unaddressed 1st TMT instability (needed Lapidus), failure to correct pronation/sesamoid malreduction, inadequate fixation leading to loss of correction, and noncompliance. Early management: splintage/taping and physiotherapy if flexible; prompt recognition of malposition may require early revision soft-tissue balancing or osteotomy adjustment. Late salvage: for varus—soft-tissue reconstruction (e.g., tendon transfer) if joint preserved, or 1st MTP fusion if stiff/arthritic; for recurrence—revision osteotomy or Lapidus if instability, and MTP fusion if painful arthritis/failed multiple procedures.",
      "explanation": "Varus is usually iatrogenic and often stems from an aggressive lateral release combined with medial tightening; examiners expect you to link the complication to specific steps. Recurrence is most often a planning error (procedure not powerful enough) or failure to address pronation/instability—simply repeating a distal osteotomy is a common mistake. Early flexible deformities can sometimes be managed non-operatively, but fixed deformity or arthritic pain usually needs fusion.

      "question": "On weight-bearing radiographs, which specific features push hallux rigidus into ‘advanced’ disease where joint-preserving surgery is unlikely to succeed?",
      "answer": "Advanced disease is suggested by near-complete joint space loss (often dorsal and central), extensive osteophytes (dorsal and periarticular), subchondral sclerosis/cysts, and flattening/irregularity of the metatarsal head with sesamoid arthritis/plantar joint involvement. Clinically, pain through mid-range (not just end-range dorsiflexion) supports advanced disease.",
      "explanation": "Cheilectomy/Moberg rely on a reasonably preserved plantar joint surface and pain predominantly at end-range dorsiflexion from dorsal impingement. Once pain occurs in mid-range with global joint degeneration, removing dorsal osteophytes or shifting the arc of motion will not address the primary pain generator.

Global arthrosis: pain throughout range (especially mid-range), night/rest pain, marked stiffness, plantar pain/sesamoid tenderness, and minimal functional dorsiflexion.",
      "explanation": "Cheilectomy addresses dorsal osteophytes and impingement; it does not reliably treat diffuse cartilage loss. Mid-range pain is a key discriminator because it implies the joint surfaces are painful under load, not just blocked dorsally.

      "question": "A patient has hallux rigidus with dorsal osteophytes and some joint space narrowing. What specific clinical/radiographic factors would make you choose (1) cheilectomy alone, (2) cheilectomy + Moberg, or (3) primary 1st MTP fusion?",
      "answer": "(1) Cheilectomy: end-range dorsiflexion pain, preserved plantar joint space, acceptable intra-op dorsiflexion after osteophyte resection. (2) Cheilectomy + Moberg: same as (1) but dorsiflexion remains functionally limited after adequate cheilectomy and plantar cartilage is preserved. (3) Fusion: mid-range pain, near-complete joint space loss/plantar degeneration or sesamoid arthritis, deformity/instability, or failed prior joint-preserving surgery.",
      "explanation": "This is fundamentally about pain pattern (impingement vs global arthrosis) and whether there is salvageable cartilage. Intra-operative assessment after cheilectomy is legitimate: if motion remains inadequate, Moberg can improve functional dorsiflexion without sacrificing the joint. Pitfall: choosing fusion solely based on low degrees of motion—some stiff joints are pain-free in mid-range and can still benefit from cheilectomy-based strategies.",

      "answer": "Explain that fusion is the most predictable for pain relief and durability, with high satisfaction and low revision; it sacrifices MTP motion but most patients walk well and can wear normal shoes. Arthroplasty may preserve some motion but has higher risks of loosening, persistent pain, implant failure, and complex revision (often to fusion with bone graft). Patient selection is critical: low-demand, good bone/soft tissues, minimal deformity, and realistic expectations.",
      "explanation": "Examiners look for balanced, patient-centred counselling and an understanding of revision pathways.

End-stage: global joint space loss, extensive osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis/cysts, sesamoid arthritis/plantar osteophytes; pain through mid-range. Early disease → cheilectomy ± Moberg; end-stage/global arthritis → 1st MTP arthrodesis (arthroplasty only in selected low-demand patients).",
      "explanation": "Cheilectomy works when pain is predominantly from dorsal impingement and there is still usable cartilage; it fails when pain is from global arthritis (mid-range pain) and when plantar joint degeneration/sesamoid arthritis is present.

High-demand patients with long-standing symptoms and radiographic global joint space loss are also poor candidates.",
      "explanation": "Cheilectomy addresses dorsal impingement; if pain is present throughout motion or at rest, the pathology is usually diffuse cartilage loss.

Endpoint: smooth dorsum with at least ~60–70° dorsiflexion intra-operatively without dorsal impingement.",
      "explanation": "The goal is to restore impingement-free dorsiflexion rather than chase radiographic perfection.

Minimise by careful patient selection (impingement-dominant pain), limited resection (typically dorsal 20–30% of met head at most), protect nerves, and early ROM post-op.",
      "explanation": "Most failures are selection errors rather than technical errors.

It is particularly useful in active patients needing dorsiflexion for gait/sport.",
      "explanation": "Moberg increases effective dorsiflexion by shifting the arc of motion dorsally, reducing dorsal joint compression during push-off.

Judge using simulated weight-bearing on a flat plate, comparing to the 2nd toe and shoe wear requirements.",

      "question": "In hallux rigidus, what are the key counselling points when comparing 1st MTP arthrodesis with arthroplasty (hemi/total/interposition)?",
      "answer": "Fusion: most reliable pain relief and durability; loss of MTP motion but good function for walking; risk of nonunion/malposition and IP joint overload. Arthroplasty/interposition: preserves some motion but has higher risk of persistent pain, loosening, transfer metatarsalgia, instability, and complex revision; revision often requires fusion with possible bone loss management.",
      "explanation": "FRCS focus is predictability and salvageability: fusion is the benchmark with reproducible outcomes, whereas implants can fail and complicate later fusion. A key trap is promising “normal motion” after arthroplasty; many retain limited motion and may still have pain. Patient selection for arthroplasty is typically low-demand, older, and accepting of revision risk.",

      "answer": "Plan for bone loss and poor bone stock: remove implant, debride to viable bone, restore length/alignment, and use structural bone graft (iliac crest/autograft/allograft) if needed; robust fixation (plate + lag) and consider prolonged protection. Address infection risk (aspiration/intra-op cultures) and manage soft-tissue envelope carefully.",
      "explanation": "Failed implants often leave cavitary defects and shortening, increasing nonunion and transfer metatarsalgia risk if not corrected.

      "question": "In suspected 2nd MTP plantar plate insufficiency, which clinical tests and imaging findings most strongly support the diagnosis and guide operative planning?",
      "answer": "Key clinical: positive dorsal drawer (Lachman) of the MTP (painful subluxation), plantar tenderness at MTP, toe deviation/crossover, loss of toe purchase (paper pull-out), and callosity under the involved metatarsal head. Imaging: weight-bearing AP/lat/oblique foot to assess metatarsal parabola, MTP subluxation, and hallux valgus; targeted ultrasound or MRI can show plantar plate tear and collateral ligament pathology. Consider WB radiographs of the whole forefoot to plan metatarsal shortening (Weil) and to identify 1st ray insufficiency driving overload.",
      "explanation": "The dorsal drawer is the most useful bedside test because it reproduces instability rather than just pain. WB radiographs are essential to identify structural drivers (long 2nd metatarsal, hallux valgus/1st ray insufficiency) that must be corrected to avoid recurrence.

Poor choice: significant MTP arthritis/degeneration requiring arthrodesis/arthroplasty strategy, severe osteoporosis/neuropathic foot, or when pain is primarily neuropathic (neuroma) or inflammatory synovitis without structural overload.",
      "explanation": "Weil is a shortening osteotomy intended to redistribute load and reduce MTP joint pressure; it does not treat neuropathic pain or end-stage joint disease.

      "explanation": "Keeping the cut parallel to the plantar surface helps avoid inadvertent plantarflexion/dorsiflexion of the metatarsal head and transfer lesions.

      "answer": "Causes: excessive metatarsal shortening, dorsal capsular tightening/scarring, intrinsic–extrinsic tendon imbalance, and inadequate correction of MTP instability/plantar plate pathology. Risk reduction: avoid over-shortening, restore MTP alignment (often combine with plantar plate repair), perform appropriate soft-tissue balancing (e.g., extensor tendon lengthening, flexor-to-extensor transfer if indicated), and ensure the metatarsal head is not dorsiflexed by the osteotomy geometry.",
      "explanation": "Floating toe is multifactorial; bone shortening alone does not correct the soft-tissue instability and may worsen purchase.

      "answer": "Look for: unaddressed plantar plate tear/MTP instability, hallux valgus/1st ray insufficiency causing transfer load, inadequate or excessive shortening (transfer metatarsalgia), malunion with head dorsiflexion, and neuroma. Salvage: plantar plate repair ± repeat/adjacent metatarsal osteotomies to rebalance parabola, correct hallux valgus/1st ray pathology, address malunion (revision osteotomy), and consider MTP stabilisation procedures; in severe degenerative MTP disease consider MTP arthrodesis/arthroplasty options depending on toe and patient factors.",

      "answer": "Principles: restore plantar restraint of the proximal phalanx on the metatarsal head, re-centre the toe (including collateral ligament balance), and address contributing overload (metatarsal length/first ray). Metatarsal shortening (e.g., Weil) decompresses the MTP, facilitates reduction, reduces tension on the repair, and lowers recurrence risk.",
      "explanation": "The plantar plate is the key static stabiliser preventing dorsal subluxation; repair without correcting overload risks failure.

PIP arthroplasty: consider in low-demand patients with flexible deformity or when preserving some motion/length is desired, but accept higher recurrence/instability risk. Always assess MTP instability—if present, address it (e.g., plantar plate/Weil) regardless of PIP choice.",

Fixation: K-wire across DIP/PIP into proximal phalanx, or intramedullary implant (e.g., cannulated device) depending on bone quality and surgeon preference. Common positioning error: fusing the toe in dorsiflexion or with residual rotation/varus, leading to dorsal rubbing/corns and poor purchase.",

      "question": "If a patient has painful 2nd MTP arthritis with fixed deformity and failed prior soft-tissue/bony procedures, what salvage options should you discuss and what factors influence choice?",
      "answer": "Options: 2nd MTP arthrodesis (selected cases), excisional/implant arthroplasty strategies (less common), or ray/forefoot reconstruction approaches depending on global forefoot pathology; address adjacent deformities (hallux valgus, other MTPs) concurrently. Choice depends on joint destruction, bone stock, soft-tissue quality, patient demand/footwear goals, and risk factors for non-union/wound problems.",
      "explanation": "When the joint surface is destroyed, stabilisation and load redistribution procedures may not relieve pain. Arthrodesis can provide pain relief and stability but risks transfer loads and stiffness; it must be aligned carefully. Viva trap: persisting with repeat plantar plate repairs in an arthritic joint where pain is from degeneration rather than instability.",

      "answer": "Key tests: dorsal drawer (Lachman) of the MTP (pain/translation), plantar plate “reverse Lachman”/plantar grip weakness, and toe purchase test (loss of plantar purchase); observe crossover/medial drift and dorsal subluxation. WB radiographs: increased 2nd metatarsal length/relative overload, MTP subluxation on lateral, and reduced MTP joint congruity; consider sesamoid position for hallux pathology. Exclude Morton’s neuroma (Mulder’s click, webspace paraesthesia) as a common mimic.",
      "explanation": "Plantar plate failure produces sagittal plane instability first (drawer), then transverse plane drift (crossover).

      "answer": "Ultrasound is useful for dynamic assessment and guided injections; MRI is preferred when surgical planning is likely or to assess extent (plantar plate, collateral ligaments, flexor sheath, marrow oedema). Significant tear features: discontinuity/attenuation of plantar plate (often distal-lateral), retraction, associated collateral ligament insufficiency, flexor tendon subluxation, and MTP joint subluxation/effusion; marrow oedema at metatarsal head supports overload.",
      "explanation": "US is operator-dependent and may miss partial tears; MRI better defines associated stabiliser failure that drives recurrence if unaddressed.

      "answer": "Regimen: activity modification, wide toe-box shoes, metatarsal dome/bar positioned proximal to metatarsal heads, taping/strapping to plantarflex the toe (reduce dorsal translation), physiotherapy for intrinsic strengthening, and treat contributing hallux valgus/first ray insufficiency. Steroid injections can weaken plantar plate/collateral ligaments and accelerate rupture/instability, risking progression to crossover deformity.",
      "explanation": "Early instability is a soft-tissue failure problem exacerbated by overload; offloading and stabilising the toe can reduce symptoms and slow progression.

Translate to desired shortening (often 2–4 mm) maintaining plantar contact, then fix with 1–2 low-profile screws (typically dorsal-to-plantar) ensuring compression and avoiding intra-articular penetration. Confirm metatarsal parabola and MTP congruity under fluoroscopy.",

      "answer": "Causes: excessive shortening, plantar plate/capsular insufficiency not addressed, extensor tendon tightness/imbalance, and dorsal scarring with MTP stiffness. Prevention: limit shortening, combine with plantar plate repair or capsular plication when instability exists, consider extensor tendon lengthening (Z-lengthening) if tight, and ensure toe is reduced with adequate plantar soft-tissue tension before closure; early controlled mobilisation and toe strapping post-op.",
      "explanation": "Weil decompresses but can reduce plantar soft-tissue tension; if the plantar plate is torn, the toe remains dorsally unstable and ‘floats’. Over-shortening also shifts load and worsens purchase—prevention is better than salvage.",

      "answer": "Isolated repair is for minimal metatarsal length abnormality with reducible instability and preserved parabola. Weil + repair is preferred when there is metatarsal overload/relative length, dorsal subluxation requiring decompression, or to gain exposure and reduce tension on the repair. Add tendon balancing (extensor lengthening, flexor-to-extensor transfer, collateral tightening) when there is fixed deformity, significant transverse plane drift/crossover, or recurrent instability risk.",

Protect the plantar digital neurovascular bundles (especially with plantar exposure) and avoid iatrogenic cartilage injury to the metatarsal head.",

      "answer": "Perform dorsal MTP exposure, then Weil osteotomy to translate the metatarsal head proximally, improving access to the plantar plate through the joint. Identify tear (often distal-lateral), pass sutures through plantar plate and secure to proximal phalanx base (bone tunnels/anchors depending on system), then reduce the toe and assess drawer stability and toe purchase. Fix the Weil with screw(s), ensuring the head is not dorsally elevated; consider temporary K-wire across MTP if stability is borderline.",
      "explanation": "The Weil creates working space and decreases tension on the repair. Stability must be checked dynamically; a visually “repaired” plate that still allows drawer will fail clinically. Over-reliance on K-wire without restoring plantar restraint is a common trap.",

      "answer": "Sequence: correct the first ray/hallux valgus (restore medial column function and space) and then address 2nd MTP instability/plantar plate and tendon balance as needed. Isolated 2nd toe surgery can fail because persistent hallux valgus continues to crowd the 2nd toe, increases lateral load, and perpetuates transverse plane drift and plantar plate stress.",

Fixed: rigid PIP contracture and/or fixed MTP subluxation; treat with PIP arthrodesis/arthroplasty plus MTP release and stabilisation (often with temporary pinning) and address plantar plate/metatarsal overload if present.",
      "explanation": "Flexible deformities are primarily dynamic imbalance; fixed deformities have capsuloligamentous contracture and joint adaptation requiring bony correction.

Fixation options: intramedullary implant or K-wire (often across PIP and sometimes into MTP for stability). Ensure the toe is not excessively shortened, avoid varus/valgus malalignment, and confirm the tip does not plantarflex excessively (risk of tip pressure).",

Over-lengthening can cause extensor lag with inadequate toe clearance and contribute to a floppy or floating toe, especially if plantar restraint is also weak.",

MRI/US can confirm plantar plate tear and collateral ligament involvement but clinical + WB films drive decision-making.",

Shorten only as required (often a few mm) to restore metatarsal parabola and permit MTP reduction; avoid excessive shortening. Fix with a low-profile screw (often 2.0–2.4 mm) from dorsal-distal into plantar-proximal fragment; check MTP congruity and toe purchase intra-op. Minimise floating toe by limiting shortening, releasing only what is necessary dorsally, addressing plantar plate/collaterals when unstable, and considering concomitant PIP correction/tendon balancing; minimise transfer pain by restoring the metatarsal parabola rather than isolated over-shortening.",

      "explanation": "Plantar plate failure is rarely purely a “tear problem”; it sits within a spectrum of metatarsal overload and soft-tissue imbalance. Weil reduces the deforming forces and improves the chance of durable reduction; tendon balancing addresses dynamic deformity that would otherwise re-subluxate the joint. Viva trap: repairing the plate without correcting the long metatarsal or extensor tightness—patients often get recurrence or floating toe.",

      "question": "What are the core principles of plantar plate repair at the lesser MTP joint, and what are the key pitfalls/complications to avoid intra-operatively?",
      "answer": "Principles: achieve anatomic reduction of the proximal phalanx on the metatarsal head, repair/reef the plantar plate (often via dorsal approach with suture passage through the plate and proximal phalanx base) and address collateral ligament attenuation if present; ensure stable toe purchase at the end. Often requires dorsal capsulotomy and extensor tendon lengthening to allow reduction without undue tension; consider temporary K-wire across the MTP in selected cases. Pitfalls: failing to correct metatarsal length/overload, over-tightening causing plantarflexion stiffness, inadequate reduction leading to recurrence, iatrogenic cartilage injury, and persistent floating toe if extensor tightness/plate insufficiency remains. Complications include stiffness, recurrence, floating toe, neurapraxia, and painful hardware if combined with Weil.",
      "explanation": "The repair must restore the plantar restraint and centralise the toe; simply “closing the capsule” does not recreate plantar stability. Over-aggressive tightening can trade instability for a stiff, painful MTP. Viva trap: ignoring collateral ligament incompetence in crossover toe—coronal plane drift persists unless addressed alongside the plate and bony alignment.",

      "answer": "Indications: fixed PIP flexion deformity causing pain/corns/shoe-wear problems, failed conservative care, and deformity not correctable with soft-tissue procedures alone. Fixation: K-wire (retrograde across PIP ± across MTP), intramedullary implant, or screw—choice depends on bone quality, infection risk, cost, and surgeon preference; aim for correct length/rotation and fusion position. At the same sitting assess MTP instability/synovitis (drawer test) and correct as needed (dorsal capsular release, extensor lengthening, plantar plate repair/Weil) to prevent recurrence and floating toe.",
      "explanation": "A hammer toe is often the distal manifestation of proximal pathology; if MTP instability is not corrected, the toe may remain dorsiflexed at the MTP with persistent symptoms despite a fused PIP. K-wires are common but bring pin-tract infection and migration risks; implants avoid external pins but can have cost/implant failure issues.

      "question": "For a symptomatic claw toe with MTP hyperextension and PIP flexion, what tendon balancing options are used, and how do you choose between extensor lengthening, flexor-to-extensor transfer, and addressing plantar plate pathology?",
      "answer": "Options: extensor tendon lengthening (often Z-lengthening) and dorsal capsular release to reduce MTP hyperextension; flexor-to-extensor transfer (Girdlestone-Taylor) to convert the flexor into a plantarflexor of the MTP and extensor of the IP joints; and plantar plate repair ± Weil when true MTP instability is present. Choose extensor lengthening/dorsal release when deformity is mainly extensor overpull and reducible; choose flexor-to-extensor transfer for dynamic clawing with relatively preserved MTP congruity; prioritise plantar plate repair/Weil when drawer-positive instability/subluxation is the driver. Combine procedures when mixed pathology exists, aiming for a stable, plantigrade toe with purchase.",
      "explanation": "Tendon balancing works when the joint is reducible and the soft tissues can be re-tensioned; it fails if the plantar restraint is structurally incompetent (plantar plate tear) or if metatarsal overload persists. Overcorrection can cause a “reverse” deformity or stiffness; undercorrection leads to recurrence.

      "answer": "Common causes: excessive metatarsal shortening/dorsiflexion of the head, unaddressed or failed plantar plate/collateral insufficiency, residual MTP subluxation, extensor tightness/scarring, and transfer metatarsalgia from altered parabola. Imaging: WB AP/lateral/oblique foot radiographs to assess metatarsal parabola, MTP congruity, and hardware position; consider ultrasound/MRI for plantar plate integrity if it will change management. Salvage: revision soft-tissue balancing (extensor lengthening, plantar plate repair/reefing, collateral reconstruction), revision metatarsal osteotomy if malpositioned (occasionally lengthening is difficult; more often address adjacent rays/pressure redistribution), MTP stabilisation with temporary pinning, and in end-stage painful arthrosis/instability consider MTP arthrodesis or resection/implant options as a last resort; optimise orthoses and callus care throughout.",
      "explanation": "Floating toe is usually a combined bony and soft-tissue problem; revising only one element often fails.

      "answer": "Think Charcot if: profound neuropathy, minimal pain, marked temperature difference vs contralateral side, swelling/erythema that reduces with elevation, normal/near-normal inflammatory markers, and no systemic upset. Infection more likely with ulcer probing to bone, purulence, systemic features, rising CRP/ESR, and focal tenderness. Initial tests: WB foot/ankle radiographs (may be normal early), CRP/ESR, HbA1c, renal profile; consider MRI if diagnostic uncertainty or to assess osteomyelitis/abscess; bedside probe-to-bone if ulcer present.",
      "explanation": "Acute Charcot is a diagnosis of urgency because continued weight-bearing accelerates collapse. Early radiographs can be normal (Eichenholtz 0), so a normal X-ray does not exclude Charcot. MRI helps when differentiating marrow oedema from osteomyelitis, but interpret in clinical context—Charcot can raise marrow signal widely, whereas osteomyelitis often tracks from an ulcer with cortical breach/abscess.

Stage 1 (development/fragmentation): fractures/subluxation, debris → strict immobilisation/offloading, avoid reconstruction unless unstable/skin threatened. Stage 2 (coalescence): decreasing warmth, early consolidation → continue protected WB in cast/boot, plan definitive bracing/footwear. Stage 3 (reconstruction/consolidation): stable deformity, bony remodelling → custom footwear/orthoses; consider corrective surgery/exostectomy/arthrodesis for recurrent ulceration or non-braceable deformity.",

Midfoot (II/III) commonly treated with plantar bony prominence management and midfoot fusion constructs; ankle/hindfoot (IV) often needs TTC/ankle fusion with robust fixation and has higher nonunion/amputation risk; calcaneal (V) risks heel ulceration and may need prolonged offloading or partial calcanectomy/amputation if infected.",
      "explanation": "Location predicts biomechanics and fixation demands: hindfoot/ankle Charcot behaves like a neuropathic nonunion problem with high lever arms.

Charcot: periarticular/subchondral marrow oedema across multiple joints, fragmentation/subluxation, relatively intact skin or oedema not tracking from an ulcer, and more diffuse midfoot involvement.",
      "explanation": "Both conditions can show marrow oedema; the key discriminator is a pathway from skin to bone and focality.

Failures: hardware breakage from premature WB, nonunion due to poor biology/infection, loss of correction, and wound breakdown (especially plantar).",

      "question": "When is partial calcanectomy a reasonable option in diabetic heel osteomyelitis, and when is BKA more appropriate?",
      "answer": "Partial calcanectomy is reasonable when infection is limited to part of the calcaneus, vascularity and soft-tissue coverage are adequate, and the patient can comply with prolonged offloading; aim to preserve a weight-bearing heel pad. BKA is more appropriate with extensive calcaneal involvement, non-salvageable heel pad/soft tissue, uncontrolled infection, severe PAD not amenable to revascularisation, or repeated failed local salvage.",
      "explanation": "Heel preservation can maintain ambulation potential but has prolonged wound risk and requires meticulous offloading. Loss of heel pad integrity is a major predictor of failure. A trap is offering partial calcanectomy when the heel pad is non-viable or vascularity is insufficient.",

      "answer": "Toe pressures and TcPO2 are most useful for predicting healing; duplex/CTA/MRA to plan revascularisation if needed. ABPI can be falsely normal/high due to medial arterial calcification, so do not rely on ABPI alone in diabetics.",

      "question": "In a diabetic with a warm, swollen, relatively painless foot and intact skin, what is the key differential and what initial tests/imaging best separate acute Charcot from infection?",
      "answer": "Key differential is osteomyelitis/septic arthritis (and cellulitis). Start with clinical context (ulcer/sinus, systemic features), inflammatory markers (CRP/WCC), and weight-bearing radiographs (often normal early). MRI is most useful: Charcot shows periarticular marrow oedema with subchondral microfractures and joint subluxation; osteomyelitis tracks from an ulcer to a focal bone with cortical breach/abscess. If uncertainty persists, consider labelled WBC scan/SPECT-CT or bone biopsy for culture/histology.",
      "explanation": "Acute Charcot and infection can look identical clinically; missing infection risks sepsis/amputation, while mislabelling Charcot as infection delays offloading and worsens collapse. MRI patterns and the presence of an ulcer communicating to bone are high-yield discriminators. Pitfall: raised CRP can occur with Charcot; interpret markers with systemic signs and ulcer status. Bone biopsy is the gold standard when treatment hinges on the diagnosis.",

      "answer": "Stage 0/1 (development/fragmentation): strict immobilisation and non-/protected weight-bearing in a total contact cast (TCC) or irremovable walker. Stage 2 (coalescence): continue immobilisation but can progress to protected weight-bearing and transition to removable devices. Stage 3 (reconstruction/consolidation): long-term custom footwear/Charcot restraint orthotic walker (CROW) and consider surgery only for stable deformity-related problems. Practical marker: temperature difference between feet—transition when within ~2°C on repeated measures and swelling/erythema have settled.",
      "explanation": "The stage reflects biological activity; operating in active fragmentation increases nonunion, fixation failure and infection.

Type 2 (tarsometatarsal/Lisfranc) and Type 3 (midfoot—naviculocuneiform/talonavicular/calcaneocuboid) commonly produce rocker-bottom collapse; Type 2/3 are the classic ulcer-prone patterns.",
      "explanation": "Location predicts deforming forces and fixation strategy (e.g., midfoot beaming vs hindfoot TTC).

Contraindications: significant infection/cellulitis requiring frequent inspection, deep/unstable ulcer needing regular wound care, critical limb ischaemia, fluctuating oedema, severe skin fragility, or inability to safely monitor (e.g., poor access/follow-up).",
      "explanation": "The benefit of TCC is enforced compliance and maximal pressure redistribution; the downside is reduced skin surveillance.

      "answer": "Assess ulcer depth and perform probe-to-bone; obtain WB radiographs; check CRP/WCC (supportive, not definitive). MRI is first-line advanced imaging to define extent and abscess. Bone biopsy (percutaneous or open) for culture/histology is indicated when diagnosis is uncertain, when prior antibiotics may confound cultures, when resistant organisms are suspected, or when prolonged antibiotics vs resection/amputation decisions depend on organism and margins.",

      "answer": "Mandates: sepsis, rapidly spreading cellulitis, necrotising infection, gas in tissues, deep abscess, compartment-like pain/tension, or critical ischaemia with infection. Operative priorities: (1) resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics after cultures, (2) urgent incision and drainage/debridement of all non-viable tissue, (3) obtain deep tissue/bone samples, (4) stabilise/offload, (5) early vascular assessment/revascularisation if ischaemic, (6) planned re-look debridement.",
      "explanation": "In diabetic sepsis, delay kills—antibiotics alone do not penetrate devitalised tissue/abscess.

Contraindications: active acute Charcot (hot foot), gross instability/subluxation needing realignment fusion, uncontrolled infection/osteomyelitis at the site, or critical ischaemia. Aim: remove the pressure point while preserving stability and soft-tissue envelope, often combined with Achilles/gastrocnemius lengthening and definitive offloading.",
      "explanation": "Exostectomy is a limb-salvage adjunct, not a deformity correction; doing it in an unstable foot risks further collapse and new ulcers.

      "answer": "Use an incision that avoids the weight-bearing plantar surface where possible (medial or dorsomedial approach to the prominence), protect neurovascular structures, and minimise soft-tissue stripping. Confirm adequacy of bony resection and preservation of key joints with fluoroscopy; avoid violating stable joints/columns. Close without tension and plan strict postoperative offloading (often TCC).",
      "explanation": "Plantar incisions in neuropathic patients have high breakdown risk; medial/dorsal approaches reduce pressure on the scar.

Optimise: glycaemic control, nutrition/albumin, smoking cessation, vascular status (revascularise if needed), renal function, and ability to comply with non-weight-bearing and follow-up.",
      "explanation": "Reconstruction fails more from biology and compliance than from implant choice. A plantigrade foot that fits a brace is the goal, not radiographic perfection.

      "answer": "Options include plantar/dorsal plating (often plantar for tension side), intramedullary 'beaming' screws/bolts across the medial and/or lateral columns, and circular external fixation (alone or hybrid). Beams provide long-segment load sharing across poor-quality bone and span multiple joints, reducing stress at any single fusion site; they also help maintain column length and plantigrade alignment.",
      "explanation": "Neuropathic bone is osteopenic and subject to high bending forces; short plates/screws fail by pull-out or breakage.

      "answer": "Choose TTC nail when soft tissues are acceptable, infection is controlled/absent, and you can achieve good alignment and compression with a stable intramedullary load-sharing device. Choose circular frame when there is active/previous infection, poor soft tissues, need for gradual correction, or when internal fixation risk is high. Technical points: correct to plantigrade with slight valgus hindfoot, maximise bony apposition, consider adjunctive compression screws, use long nail with multiple locking points, and protect with prolonged immobilisation/offloading.",
      "explanation": "Frames allow access to wounds and avoid retained metal in contaminated fields, but require pin-site care and patient tolerance.

      "answer": "Stage 1: aggressive debridement/resection of infected bone and soft tissue, obtain multiple deep cultures, start targeted antibiotics, and provide temporary stabilisation/offloading (often circular frame or splint/cast). Stage 2: once infection is controlled—healed/controlled wounds, down-trending/normalising inflammatory markers, no clinical signs of infection, and ideally negative repeat cultures if re-entering—proceed to definitive realignment arthrodesis with robust fixation. Consider antibiotic spacers/beads where appropriate.",

Hallux amputation preserves length but risks transfer lesions if first metatarsal head remains prominent. First-ray amputation is chosen when infection involves the first metatarsal/head but increases risk of varus and lateral overload. TMA is chosen for multi-ray disease to create a balanced forefoot, often with Achilles lengthening, but requires good vascularity and meticulous flap design to avoid breakdown.",
      "explanation": "The goal is a durable, shoeable, plantigrade foot; partial resections that leave bony prominences often ulcerate.

Syme/through-ankle/hindfoot amputations require excellent posterior tibial artery perfusion, good heel pad viability and patient compliance; neuropathy increases heel pad migration and ulcer risk. Consider contralateral limb status, renal disease, and rehab potential.",
      "explanation": "Distal amputations preserve length but can fail in neuropathic patients due to heel pad problems and insensate skin breakdown.

Common early complications: flap necrosis, infection, haematoma, knee flexion contracture, and poor pain control/phantom pain; later issues include stump ulceration and contralateral limb breakdown.",

Red flags: new warmth/swelling, sudden increase in deformity, new ulcer/sinus, rising inflammatory markers, or new pain (even in neuropathy) prompting WB radiographs and often MRI to exclude reactivation or infection.",

      "answer": "Assume acute Charcot until proven otherwise if neuropathic, markedly warm (often >2°C vs contralateral), swollen, relatively painless, and systemic sepsis is absent. Check CRP/WCC (often normal or mildly raised in Charcot), look for ulcer/sinus and probe-to-bone (infection risk), and obtain weight-bearing (WB) radiographs plus MRI if X-rays are normal.

      "explanation": "The viva trap is treating presumed cellulitis with antibiotics and allowing weight-bearing: this accelerates collapse. Infection is more likely with an ulcer, purulence, systemic features, markedly raised CRP, or a positive probe-to-bone; however Charcot and osteomyelitis can coexist.

      "question": "In Charcot midfoot, what are the indications and contraindications for exostectomy, and what must you assess pre-operatively to avoid failure?",
      "answer": "Indications: Eichenholtz stage 2/3 (coalescence/reconstruction) with a stable plantigrade foot but a focal bony prominence causing recurrent ulceration or impending breakdown despite optimal offloading/footwear. Contraindications: active Charcot (stage 0/1), gross instability/non-plantigrade deformity needing realignment/arthrodesis, uncontrolled infection/osteomyelitis at the site, critical limb ischaemia, or inability to comply with postoperative offloading. Pre-op assess vascular status (ABPI/toe pressures), infection (ulcer depth, probe-to-bone, MRI if needed), and whether deformity is stable on WB radiographs.",
      "explanation": "Exostectomy works when the problem is a pressure point, not an unstable deformity—if instability persists, the ulcer will recur. The common trap is operating in the active phase: bone is soft and fragmentation continues, leading to worsening collapse. Another pitfall is underestimating infection; if osteomyelitis is present, plan debridement, cultures, and staged management rather than a simple “shave down.”",

      "question": "Describe key technical steps and complication-avoidance strategies for a plantar midfoot exostectomy in Charcot, including incision choice and postoperative protocol.",
      "answer": "Use an incision that avoids the ulcer and preserves angiosomes (often a medial or dorsomedial approach rather than plantar through compromised skin); excise the bony prominence under image intensifier, aiming for a plantigrade contour while preserving stability. Send deep tissue/bone for culture if any suspicion of infection; minimise soft-tissue stripping and protect neurovascular structures. Close without tension; consider local flap input if soft tissue is marginal. Post-op: strict offloading (often TCC/irremovable walker) until wound healed, then transition to CROW/custom footwear; monitor for recurrence and new pressure points.",
      "explanation": "The viva pitfall is making a plantar incision through neuropathic scarred skin—wound breakdown is common and can precipitate deep infection. Over-resection can destabilise the midfoot and convert a stable Charcot into an unstable one, necessitating arthrodesis or amputation. Postoperative offloading is not optional; failure to offload is a leading cause of wound failure and recurrent ulceration.",

      "question": "For Charcot deformity requiring arthrodesis, how do you choose between internal fixation, external fixation, and intramedullary hindfoot nails, and what construct principles reduce nonunion and hardware failure?",
      "answer": "Choose based on location, bone quality, soft tissues, infection risk, and ability to comply: midfoot arthrodesis often needs robust plantar/medial column support (beams/plates/screws); hindfoot/ankle Charcot commonly uses a tibiotalocalcaneal (TTC) nail or circular frame, especially with poor bone and multiplanar deformity. External fixation is favoured when soft tissues are compromised, there is active/previous infection, or gradual correction is needed; internal fixation suits good soft tissues and controlled infection status. Construct principles: correct to plantigrade alignment, maximise bony contact (resect to bleeding bone), use long-segment fixation spanning multiple joints, consider “superconstruct” concepts (extend beyond zone of injury, stronger fixation, and resect deforming bone), and enforce prolonged protected weight-bearing/offloading.",
      "explanation": "Charcot bone is osteopenic and neuropathic patients overload constructs—short fixation fails. A common trap is attempting an anatomic reduction rather than a stable plantigrade foot; function and ulcer prevention trump perfect radiographs. Another pitfall is ignoring infection: if osteomyelitis is present, staged debridement and stabilisation (often frame) may be safer than immediate internal fixation.",

      "answer": "Assess clinically (ulcer size/depth, probe-to-bone, surrounding cellulitis), check inflammatory markers, and obtain WB radiographs; MRI is most useful to define osteomyelitis and abscess, while acknowledging Charcot overlap. If surgery is indicated, perform thorough debridement and take multiple deep tissue/bone samples (at least 3–5) with separate instruments before antibiotics if the patient is stable; avoid superficial swabs. Send histology if diagnosis is uncertain. Tailor antibiotics to cultures with MDT input and ensure offloading and vascular optimisation.",
      "explanation": "Superficial swabs reflect colonisers and mislead antibiotic choice—deep samples drive targeted therapy. The trap is relying on CRP/WCC alone: they can be normal in chronic osteomyelitis, and elevated markers can occur with acute Charcot.

      "question": "How do you decide the level of amputation in a diabetic/neuropathic foot (toe/ray, transmetatarsal, Syme/Pirogoff, below-knee), and what are the key functional and wound-healing trade-offs?",
      "answer": "Base level on: perfusion (toe pressures/TCPO2, vascular imaging), extent of infection/osteomyelitis, soft-tissue envelope, deformity/Charcot instability, and rehabilitation potential. Toe/ray amputation suits isolated digit osteomyelitis with good perfusion but risks transfer lesions and hallux valgus/varus depending on ray removed. Transmetatarsal amputation preserves limb length and walking but needs a durable plantar flap and Achilles/gastrocnemius lengthening consideration to reduce equinus and re-ulceration; failure is common with poor perfusion or midfoot/hindfoot Charcot. Syme/Pirogoff can allow end-bearing but require excellent posterior tibial artery supply and good soft tissues; wound complications are frequent in diabetics. Below-knee amputation offers more reliable healing when perfusion is adequate and infection is extensive, and often provides better prosthetic options than a repeatedly failing partial foot.",
      "explanation": "The viva trap is choosing the most distal level to “save length” despite marginal perfusion or uncontrolled infection—this leads to repeated debridements and prolonged morbidity. Partial foot amputations can be harder to fit and can increase plantar pressures, so you must plan tendon balancing and long-term footwear. Always frame the decision around a predictable, healable stump and the patient’s ability to mobilise with a prosthesis versus prolonged non-healing limb salvage.",

False negatives: partial tears, intact plantaris, delayed presentation with scar bridging, very swollen calf, and patient guarding; Thompson can be falsely reassuring if other plantarflexors fire.",
      "explanation": "FRCS trap is over-reliance on Thompson alone. Comparing resting tension (Matles) and function (heel raise) improves accuracy, especially when pain limits exam.

MRI is reserved for equivocal cases, suspected atypical pathology (insertional tear, tumour), pre-op planning in chronic/neglected ruptures, or when US is non-diagnostic.",
      "explanation": "Most acute ruptures are a clinical diagnosis; unnecessary MRI delays treatment.

Avoid/relative contraindications: poor skin/vascularity, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking, immunosuppression, significant neuropathy, and inability to comply with rehab.",

Aim: wean from boot around 8–10 weeks; jogging typically ~12–16 weeks; return to pivoting sports often 6–9 months depending on strength and symptoms.",
      "explanation": "The principle is tendon apposition with early controlled loading to reduce stiffness and improve function while avoiding early elongation.

Functional non-operative: avoids wound/nerve risks but has a slightly higher rerupture risk and risk of tendon elongation/strength deficit if rehab is poorly controlled.",

Tie knots away from the rupture site if possible and bury them. Before closure, check apposition and tension with the ankle in plantarflexion and perform a gentle Thompson test to confirm continuity without gapping.",

      "question": "In a suspected acute Achilles rupture, which clinical tests are most useful, and what are the key false negatives to warn about?",
      "answer": "Most useful: Thompson (calf squeeze) test, palpation for a gap, loss of resting equinus/Matles test, and inability to single-leg heel raise. False negatives: partial tears, delayed presentation with scar bridging, intact plantaris or other flexors giving some plantarflexion, and patient guarding/pain limiting exam.",
      "explanation": "Thompson is high-yield but not infallible; plantarflexion can persist via tibialis posterior, FHL/FDL and plantaris, so “some movement” does not exclude rupture. A delayed rupture may have a less obvious gap due to haematoma/scar. Always compare resting ankle position and perform Matles/Thompson bilaterally.

      "question": "When is imaging indicated for Achilles rupture, and which modality would you choose (US vs MRI) in UK practice?",
      "answer": "No imaging is required when clinical diagnosis is clear. Ultrasound is first-line if uncertainty (partial tear vs rupture, atypical exam, obesity) and for dynamic assessment; MRI is reserved for equivocal cases, suspected chronic rupture/large gap, pre-op planning, or when alternative pathology is suspected.",
      "explanation": "Over-imaging delays definitive treatment and worsens outcomes if immobilisation is delayed. Ultrasound is quick and can show tendon discontinuity and gap with dynamic plantarflexion. MRI is more expensive and slower but better for chronic tears, retraction, and associated pathology.

      "answer": "Immobilise in plantarflexion (equinus) in a backslab/boot, provide analgesia, advise non-weight bearing until specialist review (or per local functional protocol), assess neurovascular status and skin, and arrange urgent foot & ankle follow-up. Consider VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis per local policy if immobilised.",
      "explanation": "Early equinus reduces tendon-end separation and pain and prevents further gapping. Functional pathways may allow early weight bearing in a boot, but this should be protocol-led.

      "answer": "Consider surgery for: high-demand athletes/occupations requiring maximal plantarflexion strength, large tendon gap on dynamic US in plantarflexion (local threshold-dependent), delayed presentation where ends won’t appose, failed non-operative pathway, or patient preference after counselling. Avoid/relative contraindications: poor skin/vascularity, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking, immunosuppression, significant comorbidity, and high wound-risk.",
      "explanation": "With early functional rehab, rerupture rates are similar between operative and non-operative care, so the decision often hinges on wound risk vs potential strength/return-to-sport advantages and gap apposition. A large gap that persists in equinus suggests poor healing potential non-operatively. Pitfall: offering surgery to reduce rerupture without discussing wound complications and sural nerve risks.",

      "answer": "Key: wound breakdown/infection, sural nerve injury, rerupture, DVT/PE, stiffness, adhesions, painful scar, and altered strength/endurance. Open repair: higher wound complication and scar issues. Percutaneous/minimally invasive: higher sural nerve injury risk and potential malapposition if technique poor.",
      "explanation": "The exam expects you to differentiate complication profiles by approach. Open surgery gives direct apposition but at the cost of soft-tissue insult; percutaneous reduces wound problems but risks nerve injury and inadequate purchase.

      "explanation": "Early functional rehab reduces tendon elongation and stiffness compared with prolonged casting and narrows rerupture differences versus surgery. The critical pitfall is allowing early dorsiflexion stretching, which increases elongation and weak push-off.

      "answer": "Prone (or lateral) with tourniquet optional; posteromedial longitudinal incision to reduce sural nerve risk and avoid tenuous midline skin. Debride frayed ends minimally, perform end-to-end repair with a strong locking suture (e.g., Krackow/Bunnell) using non-absorbable high-strength suture, tie with ankle in plantarflexion, paratenon closure, meticulous skin handling, then boot/cast in equinus.",
      "explanation": "Posteromedial incision avoids the sural nerve laterally and reduces wound issues compared with a central incision over poor skin. Locking stitches distribute load and reduce gapping. Paratenon closure improves gliding and may reduce adhesions. Pitfall: excessive debridement shortening the tendon and overtightening leading to equinus contracture.",

      "question": "What are the key technical points in percutaneous Achilles repair to minimise sural nerve injury and ensure tendon apposition?",
      "answer": "Mark the sural nerve course (typically lateral), use small medial and midline stab incisions preferentially, keep lateral passes anterior to the nerve plane, use a jig/device if available, confirm tendon capture by palpation and plantarflexion tensioning, and tie with the ankle in plantarflexion. Consider limited open exposure at the rupture site to visualise apposition if uncertain.",
      "explanation": "Sural nerve injury is the classic viva trap; it runs posterolateral and is vulnerable to lateral needle passes. Ensuring true tendon purchase avoids “skin-only” sutures and gapping. Limited-open or mini-open techniques can balance wound and nerve risks. Pitfall: assuming percutaneous is always safer—nerve injury and malreduction can be functionally devastating.",

      "answer": "Compare resting equinus to the contralateral side, assess passive dorsiflexion end-point, and check plantarflexion strength/tendon continuity through ROM with the knee flexed/extended. Over-tensioning risks equinus contracture, altered gait and anterior ankle impingement; under-tensioning leads to tendon elongation, weak push-off, and poor return to sport.",
      "explanation": "Functional outcome is highly sensitive to tendon length. Contralateral comparison is practical and expected in a viva. Under-tensioning is common if knots are tied without adequate plantarflexion or if the repair gapes. Pitfall: chasing “tightness” and creating iatrogenic equinus, particularly in muscular athletes.",

      "answer": "Use early functional rehabilitation in a boot with wedges, progressing weight bearing and wedge removal per protocol, with early controlled ROM (plantarflexion and gentle dorsiflexion to neutral only initially). Avoid forced dorsiflexion stretching and high-load eccentric work in the early healing phase.",
      "explanation": "Early controlled loading promotes tendon healing and reduces complications of prolonged immobilisation.

      "answer": "Options: re-start non-operative functional protocol if minimal gap and good apposition; operative repair (often preferred) if significant gap, high demand, or poor compliance; consider augmentation if tissue quality poor. Choice depends on gap on dynamic US/MRI, time from rerupture, skin/wound risk, and patient goals.",
      "explanation": "Early rerupture suggests inadequate apposition or non-compliance; surgery can restore length and reduce further elongation but increases wound/nerve risks.

If tendon is exposed or soft tissue is compromised, involve plastics early for coverage options (local rotational flap/free flap) and consider negative pressure therapy as a bridge. Protect the repair with immobilisation and avoid tension on the skin.",

Initial management is reassurance, neuropathic analgesia and observation; persistent severe symptoms or evidence of entrapment may require exploration and suture removal/neurolysis.",
      "explanation": "Most neurapraxias improve, but suture entrapment can cause ongoing pain and dysaesthesia.

Assess gait, calf wasting, ability to single-leg heel raise, resting ankle position, and palpable gap; evaluate skin and comorbidities. Imaging (US/MRI) to measure gap size, tendon quality, and retraction guides whether end-to-end repair, V–Y lengthening, turn-down flap, or tendon transfer (e.g., FHL) is needed.",

Alternatives: V–Y gastrocnemius aponeurotic lengthening, gastrosoleus fascial turn-down flap, peroneus brevis transfer, hamstring autograft/allograft reconstruction, or flexor digitorum longus transfer.",
      "explanation": "FHL is favoured because it is strong, in-phase with plantarflexion, and has a reliable muscle belly excursion. Choice depends on gap size, tissue quality, and patient demands.

Consider additional augmentation (V–Y/turn-down) if residual gap remains.",
      "explanation": "Fixation in the calcaneus restores a plantarflexion moment arm and provides a robust construct.

Also counsel about wound issues, sural/tibial nerve irritation, and prolonged rehab.",
      "explanation": "The common viva trap is overstating disability—most patients tolerate FHL transfer well, but high-demand athletes may notice deficits.

Differentials: gastrocnemius/soleus strain, plantaris rupture, posterior ankle impingement, and tibialis posterior dysfunction (less acute pop).",

      "answer": "Functional non-op: suitable for most acute ruptures if early diagnosis, compliant patient, and access to an accelerated functional rehab pathway; avoid if delayed presentation, inability to comply, or very high-demand athlete where marginally lower re-rupture risk is desired. Percutaneous repair: acute closed rupture with good tendon apposition, aiming to reduce wound complications vs open; avoid if atypical/very proximal-distal tear, large gap on dynamic US, or concern about sural nerve course/scarring. Open repair: when tendon ends cannot be reliably opposed (large gap), delayed presentation but still repairable, complex tear pattern, revision after re-rupture, or when augmentation is planned; higher wound risk. Rehab principle: early functional rehabilitation with protected early weight-bearing and early controlled ankle motion in plantarflexion (rather than prolonged immobilisation) to reduce re-rupture and stiffness.",
      "explanation": "The viva trap is assuming surgery is mandatory for athletes: modern functional non-op protocols can achieve comparable outcomes to surgery when started early and adhered to, but failure to provide an accelerated pathway (or poor compliance) increases re-rupture risk. Percutaneous techniques reduce wound breakdown/infection but introduce sural nerve injury risk; incision placement and careful lateral dissection/needle trajectory matter. Open repair gives direct visualisation and allows debridement/augmentation but has higher soft-tissue complication rates, especially in smokers/diabetics and with tenuous posterior skin.

      "answer": "Indications: chronic rupture/neglected tear (typically >4–6 weeks) with poor-quality tendon ends and a persistent gap not closable without undue tension; commonly used for gaps ~3–6 cm (often with V–Y advancement if needed) and as salvage after failed repair. Key steps/construct: posterior/medial approach; debride scar and freshen ends; harvest FHL (preferably distal to the knot of Henry for length) and transfer through a calcaneal tunnel or into a calcaneal socket with interference screw/tenodesis screw; tension with ankle in plantarflexion; augment/repair Achilles stump over the transfer (side-to-side). Complications/counselling: wound problems, sural nerve injury, DVT, re-rupture/elongation, and loss of hallux IP flexion strength (usually minimal functional deficit); avoid over-tensioning (limits dorsiflexion) and under-tensioning (weak push-off).",
      "explanation": "FHL is favoured because it fires in-phase with gastrosoleus, is close to the Achilles, and provides a strong vascularised tendon to bridge deficient tissue—key in chronic cases where end-to-end repair would be under tension and prone to elongation. A common trap is ignoring the gap size and tissue quality: small gaps with good tissue may be treated with end-to-end repair or V–Y advancement alone, whereas very large gaps may need additional augmentation (e.g., turn-down flap/allograft) beyond FHL. Protect the sural nerve laterally and the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle medially; meticulous handling of the thin posterior heel skin reduces wound breakdown.

      "explanation": "The operation has a high wound-complication profile because of tenuous posterior heel soft tissues; risk modification is part of decision-making. Misdiagnosis (mid-portion vs insertional) is a frequent pitfall leading to persistent pain. Significant malalignment or equinus can overload the insertion and must be addressed to avoid failure/recurrence.",

      "question": "Which imaging is most useful pre-operatively and what specific findings change surgical strategy?",
      "answer": "Weight-bearing lateral hindfoot/ankle radiograph to assess posterosuperior calcaneal prominence, insertional enthesophytes, and calcification; consider axial/heel view if needed. Ultrasound can confirm bursitis and tendon degeneration; MRI is most useful to quantify tendon degeneration/partial tearing and extent of insertional disease. Extensive intratendinous degeneration or large partial tear suggests need for more debridement, stronger reattachment construct, and possible augmentation (e.g. FHL transfer) if >50% tendon compromised.",
      "explanation": "WB radiographs help plan the amount and location of bone resection and identify large enthesophytes that may require tendon detachment. MRI guides whether simple bursectomy/exostectomy is enough or whether formal debridement with reattachment/augmentation is required. A key viva trap is over-relying on “Haglund angle” metrics; treat the patient and concordant pathology rather than radiographic shape alone.",

      "question": "How do you clinically distinguish predominant retrocalcaneal bursitis from insertional Achilles tendinopathy, and why does it matter surgically?",
      "answer": "Retrocalcaneal bursitis: deep pain anterior to Achilles insertion, worse with dorsiflexion and shoe counter pressure; swelling may be more anterior/medial-lateral. Insertional tendinopathy: pain and thickening at the tendon insertion/posterior calcaneus, often with enthesophyte tenderness; heel raise may be painful/weak. Predominant bursitis may be treated with endoscopic/open bursectomy and limited exostectomy without extensive tendon detachment; significant insertional tendinopathy often needs debridement and secure reattachment.",
      "explanation": "Matching the procedure to the dominant pain generator reduces persistent pain and avoids unnecessary tendon detachment (which increases risk of weakness and wound issues).

      "answer": "Choose endoscopic when pathology is mainly retrocalcaneal bursitis and posterosuperior calcaneal prominence with minimal insertional tendon degeneration and no need for tendon detachment/reattachment. Limitations: limited ability to debride/repair significant insertional tendinopathy, difficulty addressing large enthesophytes requiring detachment, and risk of inadequate bony resection if landmarks are misread. Avoid if extensive tendon disease, poor visibility due to scarring, or need for augmentation.",
      "explanation": "Endoscopy can reduce wound problems and speed recovery but is not a substitute for formal insertional debridement/reattachment when the tendon is diseased.

      "answer": "Options: central longitudinal posterior incision (splitting paratenon), medial or lateral longitudinal incision just off midline, or a Cincinnati/curved incision in selected cases. Minimise wound issues by avoiding a transverse incision across the posterior heel, respecting angiosomes (often prefer medial-sided incision), meticulous paratenon handling/closure, limited soft tissue stripping, and careful retraction to protect sural nerve laterally. Optimise patient factors (stop smoking, control diabetes) and avoid excessive tension on closure.",
      "explanation": "Posterior heel skin has limited vascularity and is prone to breakdown; incision choice and soft tissue handling are critical. A common pitfall is placing the incision too lateral and injuring the sural nerve or creating a poorly perfused flap. Central splitting gives direct access for detachment/reattachment but must be balanced against wound risk in high-risk patients.",

      "answer": "Expose posterosuperior calcaneus, identify the Achilles insertion footprint, and resect the prominence with osteotome/burr under direct vision, smoothing edges. Use intra-operative fluoroscopy (lateral) to confirm adequate resection and avoid leaving a sharp ridge. Avoid excessive resection that compromises the insertional footprint or weakens the tuberosity; preserve enough bone for anchor fixation if reattachment planned.",
      "explanation": "Under-resection is a common cause of persistent impingement; over-resection risks weakening fixation purchase and altering biomechanics. Fluoroscopy helps confirm the contour, especially when the prominence is not obvious after soft tissue removal. Another pitfall is leaving a prominent lateral/medial edge that still rubs the tendon/bursa.",

Protect Achilles fibres (avoid iatrogenic detachment/longitudinal splitting), preserve paratenon for closure, and protect sural nerve (especially with lateral approach). Ensure haemostasis to reduce haematoma and wound breakdown.",

      "question": "What is your threshold for partial vs complete Achilles detachment during insertional debridement, and how does it affect fixation choice?",
      "answer": "If debridement requires removal of >40–50% of the insertional tendon or access to large enthesophytes/calcification, perform complete detachment and formal reattachment. If <40–50% and adequate access is possible, consider partial detachment with limited reattachment/side-to-side repair. Complete detachment typically needs a robust double-row/suture-bridge anchor construct; partial detachment may be managed with single-row anchors or transosseous sutures depending on bone quality and tendon quality.",
      "explanation": "The threshold is pragmatic: beyond ~50% remaining tendon may be insufficient for strength and healing without formal reattachment. A viva trap is underestimating tendon compromise and using a weak construct, leading to elongation or failure. Fixation choice should match tendon loss, bone quality, and expected rehabilitation demands.",

      "answer": "Double-row: place 2 proximal anchors in the calcaneal tuberosity near the original footprint, pass sutures through the tendon (e.g. Krackow/mattress), then secure laterally/distally with 2 additional anchors to create a suture-bridge compressing tendon onto bone. Advantages: larger footprint compression, higher initial fixation strength, reduced gap formation, and potentially improved healing surface area compared with single-row.",
      "explanation": "Insertional healing benefits from broad tendon-to-bone contact and stable compression; suture-bridge constructs provide this and are commonly used in high-demand patients.

      "answer": "Place anchors in the posterosuperior calcaneal tuberosity within the native footprint, aiming for good cancellous purchase and avoiding cortical breach; use fluoroscopy if uncertain. In poor bone: consider larger diameter anchors, switching to transosseous tunnels with non-absorbable sutures, adding a calcaneal bone block if available, or augmenting with FHL transfer to offload the repair. Avoid relying on a single anchor point.",
      "explanation": "Anchor pull-out is a key failure mode, especially in osteoporotic bone or after aggressive exostectomy. Transosseous fixation can be more reliable when cancellous purchase is limited. Augmentation addresses both fixation and biological tendon deficiency.",

Begin gentle ROM once wound healed, remove wedges gradually from ~4–8 weeks, start strengthening later (often ≥8–12 weeks), and return to running/sport commonly 4–6+ months depending on symptoms and strength.",
      "explanation": "The repair needs protection from early dorsiflexion and high tensile loads that can cause gapping or anchor failure.

Lateral/paratendinous: good for isolated retrocalcaneal bursectomy/exostectomy with minimal tendon disease; lower risk of splitting tendon but higher risk to sural nerve (especially posterolateral) and less direct access to medial insertional pathology.",
      "explanation": "Approach choice should match pathology: if the tendon insertion needs debridement/reattachment, a central split gives symmetric access and facilitates anchor placement. If the tendon is largely healthy and the problem is bursal/Haglund, a paratendinous approach avoids violating the tendon.

      "question": "Describe the key steps of open retrocalcaneal bursectomy and how you avoid iatrogenic Achilles insertion injury.",
      "answer": "Expose via central split or paratendinous approach; identify the retrocalcaneal bursa deep to Achilles and excise it completely; debride inflamed synovium and any prominent posterosuperior calcaneal bone impinging on the tendon; preserve as much healthy tendon insertion as possible and avoid aggressive deep dissection at the insertion footprint; confirm full ankle dorsiflexion without impingement before closure.",
      "explanation": "The bursa is deep to the tendon and can be mistaken for tendon degeneration—stay in the correct plane and protect the insertion. Incomplete bursectomy or under-resection of the impinging bone is a common cause of persistent symptoms. Over-resection or careless curettage at the footprint risks partial avulsion and weakens the insertion, converting a bursectomy into an unplanned reattachment case.",

      "question": "What are the technical principles of calcaneal exostectomy for Haglund deformity, and how do you judge adequate resection intra-operatively?",
      "answer": "Resect the posterosuperior calcaneal prominence causing impingement, contouring to a smooth slope without creating a sharp edge; protect Achilles fibres and avoid violating the insertion footprint unnecessarily; use intra-op fluoroscopy (lateral view) and dynamic ankle dorsiflexion to ensure no residual impingement; irrigate thoroughly to reduce heterotopic ossification risk.",
      "explanation": "Under-resection leaves ongoing mechanical conflict and is a common reason for failure. Over-resection can destabilise the insertion, weaken the posterior calcaneus, and create a stress riser; it may also increase the need for tendon detachment/reattachment. Fluoroscopy plus dynamic assessment is more reliable than visual estimation alone, especially in large heels or distorted anatomy.",

      "question": "What intra-operative factors determine whether you can do a partial detachment versus near-complete detachment of the Achilles insertion, and what is the consequence for fixation strategy?",
      "answer": "Detachment extent is dictated by how much diseased tendon and enthesophyte must be excised to reach healthy fibres and remove impinging bone. If a substantial healthy tendon bridge remains attached, partial detachment may allow simpler reattachment/repair; if >~50% of the insertion is detached or tendon quality is poor, treat as near-complete detachment requiring robust anchor-based reattachment (often double-row) and consider augmentation (e.g., FHL transfer) in severe degeneration.",
      "explanation": "The goal is durable pain relief by excising diseased tissue; leaving degenerate tendon to preserve attachment risks persistent symptoms. Conversely, excessive detachment without a plan increases risk of failure and prolonged rehab.

      "question": "Compare single-row versus double-row (suture-bridge) anchor constructs for Achilles insertion reattachment: when would you choose each and why?",
      "answer": "Single-row: acceptable when detachment is limited, tendon quality is good, and bone stock is reliable; simpler and less implant burden. Double-row/suture-bridge: preferred for near-complete detachment, larger footprint restoration, poorer tendon quality, or higher-demand patients; provides broader compression and potentially improved contact area/initial fixation strength. Avoid double-row if calcaneal bone stock is poor or there is limited space risking anchor convergence.",
      "explanation": "Double-row constructs aim to recreate the native footprint and distribute load, which is helpful when the tendon-bone interface is compromised. However, more anchors increase cost and risk of technical errors (malposition, convergence, cortical breach). The exam focus is matching construct to pathology and bone quality rather than defaulting to “strongest” for all cases.",

      "explanation": "Calcaneal bone can be osteopenic or weakened by exostectomy—anchor pullout is a real failure mode. Converging tunnels reduce purchase and can fracture the posterior calcaneus.

      "answer": "Risk reduction: meticulous soft-tissue handling, avoid excessive undermining, maintain thick skin flaps, careful haemostasis, consider offloading closure tension, and use a well-padded splint/boot avoiding posterior pressure. Optimise modifiable risks (smoking cessation, glycaemic control). Caution/alternatives in smokers, poorly controlled diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, inflammatory arthropathy, or prior posterior heel scars—consider less invasive approaches, staged surgery, or modified incision placement.",
      "explanation": "Posterior heel skin has limited vascularity and is prone to pressure necrosis post-op.

Work-up: focused exam (tenderness location, nerve symptoms, swelling, wound), WB lateral radiograph for residual prominence/anchor position, USS/MRI for tendon integrity and bursitis, and inflammatory markers if infection suspected; consider diagnostic local anaesthetic injection to localise pain (bursa vs tendon vs nerve).",
      "explanation": "Most revisions fail because the original pain generator wasn’t fully addressed or a new one was created (hardware/nerve).

      "question": "When would you add an FHL transfer/augmentation in insertional Achilles surgery, and what are the key technical/viva points?",
      "answer": "Consider FHL transfer when there is extensive tendon degeneration with poor-quality remaining Achilles (often near-complete detachment with large debridement), revision cases, older/low-demand patients with weak tendon, or when secure reattachment alone is doubtful. Key points: harvest FHL (commonly via posteromedial approach), route to calcaneus and fix (interference screw/anchor), tension in slight plantarflexion, and preserve neurovascular structures; counsel on potential subtle hallux IP flexion weakness (usually well tolerated).",
      "explanation": "FHL provides a vascular, in-phase plantarflexor to share load and improve durability when native tendon is compromised. The trap is using it routinely without indication (added morbidity) or failing to tension it correctly, leading to weakness or over-tightness. Also ensure the primary mechanical conflict (Haglund/exostosis) has been adequately addressed—augmentation won’t fix impingement.",

      "question": "In suspected chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI), what are the key history and examination features that distinguish mechanical instability from functional instability, and why does it matter for management?",
      "answer": "Mechanical: recurrent sprains + objective laxity (positive anterior drawer/talar tilt), often swelling after episodes; Functional: subjective giving way without clear laxity, proprioceptive deficit, peroneal weakness, poor balance. It matters because functional instability prioritises rehab (proprioception/peroneals) and addressing pain generators; mechanical instability with failed rehab is an indication for ligament repair/reconstruction.",
      "explanation": "FRCS trap is operating on ‘giving way’ without objective instability or without exhausting rehab. Mechanical instability reflects ATFL/CFL insufficiency and responds to repair/reconstruction; functional instability often improves with neuromuscular training and treating associated pathology (e.g. impingement, osteochondral lesion).

Stress radiographs (anterior drawer/talar tilt) if diagnosis unclear: quantify laxity. MRI: ATFL/CFL quality, peroneal tendons, osteochondral lesion of talus (OLT), syndesmosis, impingement/scar. CT (often WBCT) if bony impingement/arthritis/OLT morphology or subtle malalignment suspected.",
      "explanation": "WB radiographs are essential to avoid missing early arthritis and cavovarus (a common cause of failed Broström).

Tests: external rotation stress test, squeeze test, cross-leg test, dorsiflexion-compression test; compare sides. Lateral ligament tests (anterior drawer/talar tilt) may be normal or only mildly positive.",
      "explanation": "A common viva trap is attributing persistent anterolateral pain to ATFL alone and performing Broström, missing syndesmotic instability.

      "answer": "Look for increased anterior translation on anterior drawer stress and increased talar tilt on varus stress compared with contralateral side; interpret alongside symptoms and exam. Pitfalls: patient guarding, inconsistent force, rotational malposition, generalised ligamentous laxity, and hindfoot varus causing apparent tilt. A normal stress view does not exclude functional instability or pain generators (OLT/impingement/peroneals).",
      "explanation": "FRCS examiners want you to acknowledge that thresholds vary and side-to-side comparison is often more useful than absolute numbers.

Plan combined ankle arthroscopy (debridement/OLT management) with ligament repair/reconstruction rather than isolated Broström. If significant arthritis is present, consider joint-preserving vs salvage options instead of ligament surgery alone.",
      "explanation": "Up to a significant proportion of CLAI patients have intra-articular pathology; missing it is a common reason for persistent pain after a technically sound Broström.

Risks/limitations: higher technical demand, potential nerve injury (superficial peroneal), anchor malposition, limited ability to address poor tissue quality, and difficulty incorporating robust Gould augmentation in some techniques.",

      "answer": "Concern: increased tibiofibular clear space, reduced tibiofibular overlap, and medial clear space widening (suggesting talar shift) compared with the other side. Limitations: chronic instability may be subtle or dynamic and can appear normal on static WB views; malrotation and positioning can mimic abnormal measurements. If suspicion persists, use CT (side-to-side), MRI, stress imaging, or arthroscopic assessment.",
      "explanation": "Static radiographs can miss dynamic syndesmotic instability—classic reason for failed lateral ligament surgery. Side-to-side CT is helpful for subtle fibular malposition. Always interpret radiographs with clinical tests and mechanism (external rotation/dorsiflexion pain).",

      "answer": "Role: diagnose/treat intra-articular pathology (impingement, OLT, loose bodies), assess cartilage, and evaluate syndesmosis dynamically. Plan changes: treat OLT (debridement/microfracture or fixation depending on lesion), debride impingement, address loose bodies, and if syndesmotic instability is confirmed consider stabilisation rather than isolated Broström. Significant diffuse chondral loss may shift towards joint-preserving/salvage discussions.",
      "explanation": "Arthroscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic; it reduces the risk of persistent pain from missed lesions.

Risks of aggressive early inversion/return: stretching/failure of repair, recurrent instability; risks of prolonged immobilisation: stiffness, weakness, DVT.",

Avoidance: careful incision/identification of nerve branches, gentle soft-tissue handling, anatomic anchor placement, correct tensioning in neutral, avoid excessive retinacular tethering, address alignment and associated pathology, and appropriate post-op protection/rehab.",
      "explanation": "Nerve injury is a frequent FRCS discussion point—know where the superficial peroneal nerve crosses and that arthroscopic portals also carry risk.

      "answer": "Prioritise arthritis management: optimise non-operative care; consider joint-preserving options only if early disease and correctable mechanics. Ligament stabilisation alone is unlikely to relieve arthritic pain. Surgical options: debridement/cheilectomy for focal impingement with mild arthritis, supramalleolar osteotomy if malalignment-driven early arthritis, and for end-stage disease ankle arthrodesis or total ankle replacement (with careful consideration of instability/alignment and need for concomitant ligament reconstruction).",
      "explanation": "Viva trap: offering Broström for pain from arthritis—stability may improve but pain persists. Alignment correction can be disease-modifying in selected early cases. In arthroplasty, instability and cavovarus must be corrected to avoid failure; in fusion, position is critical to function and adjacent joint overload.",

      "answer": "Weight-bearing (WB) AP/mortise/lateral ankle radiographs ± hindfoot alignment view: look for varus hindfoot, osteophytes/impingement, talar tilt, arthritis, avulsion fragments (os subfibulare). Stress radiographs (anterior drawer and talar tilt) if tolerated: quantify laxity and compare to contralateral. MRI: assess ATFL/CFL quality, osteochondral lesion of talus (OLT), peroneal tendons, anterolateral impingement/scar, syndesmosis injury. CT (often WBCT): define OLT, subtle malalignment, anterior tibial/talar osteophytes, and occult fractures; useful pre-op planning.",
      "explanation": "WB radiographs are essential because malalignment (especially cavovarus) drives failure if uncorrected. Stress radiographs can support diagnosis but are technique-dependent and may be falsely negative if the patient guards. MRI is less about proving laxity and more about identifying associated pathology that changes the operation (OLT, peroneal tears, syndesmosis).

      "question": "Which clinical features should make you suspect syndesmotic pathology rather than isolated lateral ligament instability in a patient with recurrent sprains?",
      "answer": "Pain is more anterior/proximal at the distal tibiofibular joint, worse with external rotation/dorsiflexion and push-off; tenderness over AITFL; positive squeeze test/external rotation stress; sense of 'giving way' with dorsiflexion rather than inversion; reduced dorsiflexion and pain with single-leg hop. History of high ankle sprain or prolonged recovery after a sprain supports syndesmosis.",
      "explanation": "A common viva trap is to treat all recurrent sprains as ATFL/CFL failure; syndesmotic injury presents with different pain location and provocative tests. Isolated mechanical instability often has lateral gutter tenderness and inversion-related giving way. Missing syndesmotic instability leads to persistent pain and failure of a Broström because the primary pathology is not addressed.",

      "question": "How do you clinically differentiate mechanical instability from functional instability, and why does it matter for operative decision-making?",
      "answer": "Mechanical instability: objective laxity on anterior drawer/talar tilt compared to contralateral, often with end-point loss. Functional instability: subjective giving way with normal/near-normal laxity, often due to proprioceptive deficit, peroneal weakness, or neuromuscular control issues. Surgery is primarily for mechanical instability after failed rehab; functional instability is treated with targeted physiotherapy, bracing, and addressing peroneal dysfunction.",
      "explanation": "Operating on functional instability alone is a classic pitfall and yields poor satisfaction. Mechanical instability correlates better with ligament insufficiency and benefits from repair/reconstruction.

Limitations: technique variability, patient guarding, pain limiting stress, and false positives in generalised laxity; results must be interpreted with symptoms and exam.",

Relative contraindications: generalised ligamentous laxity, poor/attenuated ATFL/CFL tissue, high-demand revision cases, significant cavovarus not corrected, advanced ankle arthritis, neuropathic joint, and uncontrolled infection/skin compromise.",
      "explanation": "Broström-Gould is an anatomic repair and relies on tissue quality and correct biomechanics. The common trap is ignoring cavovarus or peroneal pathology—both increase recurrence. In lax patients or revisions, a reconstruction is often more durable than repeated repair.",

Identify and imbricate ATFL ± CFL to fibular footprint using suture anchors or transosseous sutures with the ankle in neutral/slight eversion. Gould augmentation: advance the inferior extensor retinaculum to the fibula to reinforce the repair and improve stability. Close in layers; consider addressing impingement/osteophytes if present.",
      "explanation": "The augmentation adds a secondary restraint and can improve strength, particularly when native ligament is attenuated.

      "answer": "Place anchors at the anteroinferior distal fibula at the native ATFL footprint, and if repairing CFL, more posteroinferiorly at the CFL footprint; maintain adequate bone bridge and avoid too distal placement near the tip. Avoid fibular fracture (especially with multiple large anchors), intra-articular penetration, and peroneal tendon irritation from prominent hardware.",
      "explanation": "Correct footprint placement restores anatomic restraint; malposition can create non-anatomic tensioning and persistent instability.

Treat with debridement, microfracture/drilling for appropriate OLTs, and removal of loose bodies/osteophytes as indicated.",
      "explanation": "Many patients with chronic instability have concomitant intra-articular lesions that drive symptoms; repairing ligaments alone may not resolve pain.

Assess hindfoot flexibility (Coleman block test) and alignment on WB imaging. Consider corrective procedures such as lateralising calcaneal osteotomy for fixed hindfoot varus, first-ray dorsiflexion osteotomy for plantarflexed first ray, and peroneal/tibialis posterior balancing as indicated, alongside ligament repair/reconstruction.",
      "explanation": "Uncorrected varus is a high-yield reason for Broström failure.

      "answer": "Prefer an anatomic ligament reconstruction (ATFL ± CFL) using tendon graft (autograft/allograft) rather than simple Broström repair, because native tissue is often insufficient and recurrence risk is higher. Ensure alignment and peroneal function are addressed; consider augmentation/internal brace selectively. Post-op protection and slower rehab are typically required.",
      "explanation": "Laxity is a classic viva modifier: a repair that relies on poor collagen quality stretches out. An anatomic reconstruction aims to restore restraint with a stronger construct. A pitfall is performing a standard Broström and blaming the patient when it fails.",

If tissue quality is poor or laxity persists, perform an anatomic reconstruction with graft; correct malalignment concurrently and treat peroneal/OLT/impingement pathology. Consider non-anatomic tenodesis only if anatomic reconstruction is not feasible; arthrodesis is a last resort in severe arthritis/failed multiple surgeries.",
      "explanation": "Revision success depends on identifying why the first operation failed—most commonly uncorrected varus, missed syndesmotic instability, or untreated peroneal/OLT pathology.

Away from surgery: predominantly functional instability without objective laxity (responds to rehab) or advanced painful arthritis where stabilisation won’t address symptoms.",

After graft reconstruction: longer protection and slower progression, delaying high-stress inversion/eversion and return to pivoting sport.",

Preferable to non-anatomic tenodesis because it preserves more normal kinematics, reduces subtalar stiffness, and has better functional outcomes; reserve non-anatomic procedures for salvage when anatomic reconstruction is not feasible.",
