        "category": "FRCS Viva",
        "question": "In talar avascular necrosis, why might TTC fusion be chosen over isolated ankle fusion?",
        "answer": "Because the subtalar joint and talar body viability may be compromised; TTC provides a more stable salvage construct spanning the talus.",

        "question": "What is the first principle when evaluating a painful TTC nail/fusion with suspected infection?",
        "answer": "Assume infection until proven otherwise and evaluate clinically plus inflammatory markers and imaging; consider aspiration if appropriate.",
        "explanation": "Infection dramatically changes management, including potential staged revision and debridement."

        "question": "Why is ankle stiffness so common after pilon fractures?",
        "answer": "Articular injury, capsular scarring, prolonged immobilisation/limited weight bearing, and soft-tissue trauma.",
        "explanation": "Early safe motion when permitted and good physio are important, but stiffness may persist."

        "question": "What is a realistic expectation to set with patients about recovery timeline after a severe pilon fracture?",
        "answer": "Prolonged recovery with months of rehab; swelling and stiffness can persist long-term and function may not return to baseline.",
        "explanation": "Expectation management helps adherence and reduces dissatisfaction given the injury severity."

        "question": "What is a common functional limitation after TTC fusion even with union?",
        "answer": "Difficulty walking on uneven ground and reduced ability to accommodate slopes due to loss of hindfoot motion.",
        "explanation": "Subtalar and ankle motion normally adapt to uneven surfaces; fusion makes gait more rigid."

        "question": "Why might adjacent joints become symptomatic after TTC fusion?",
        "answer": "Increased compensatory motion and load through midfoot and more proximal joints.",
        "explanation": "Loss of hindfoot motion shifts biomechanics, potentially accelerating adjacent joint degeneration."

        "answer": "Often around 7–14 days, guided by soft tissues (wrinkle sign), not the calendar.",
        "explanation": "Swelling, blisters, and skin condition dictate timing; operate when tissues are ready."

        "answer": "Aim for anatomic reduction with step/gap as close to 0 as possible; <2 mm is a commonly used benchmark.",
        "explanation": "Residual incongruity increases contact stress and is associated with worse long-term outcomes."

        "answer": "Slight valgus (~5°) to improve tolerance and reduce lateral border overload.",
        "explanation": "A small valgus angle is generally functional and reduces painful overload compared with varus."
